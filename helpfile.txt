 ============== abbreviations =============
If you are abbreviating commands, you must be prepared to change
your habitual abbreviations when new commands are introduced.
New commands may make old abbreviations ambiguous.
 ============== abort =============
To cancel a CIX command, enter <control>X.  If, for instance, you have
disabled the More? prompt by setting your terminal pagelength to 0, you could
enter ^X to cancel a large volume of output; note that this will not take
effect immediately, due to the buffering between the CIX software and your
terminal.

To cancel your input at a prompt and start again, enter <control>U.  This may
be more convenient than entering a number of Backspace characters.

Description: Netfind

Address:     bruno.cs.colorado.edu

Interest:    E-mail directory

Access:      

telnet bruno.cs.colorado.edu
-OR-
telnet mudhoney.micro.umn.edu
login as netfind

Comments:

This will allow you to search the whole internet for addresses.
Netfind is very persistant but will fail on hosts that don't allow
finger access (such as most British Universities).  The bruno site is
more verbose in it's search, but does have an options feature which
may allow you to turn this off.  The mudhoney site is quiet and does
not allow you to select options.

 ============== absence =============
Command:   ABSENCE -- Notify someone who wants to send you mail of your
           absence.

Prompts:   Main:  Read:  Mail:

Format:    ABSENCE [FIRST <dd/mm/yy>] [LAST <dd/mm/yy>]

Example:   absence last 25/8/91

Usage:     If you have no existing ABSENCE record, specify FIRST and/or LAST
           in either order.  If you specify FIRST only, you are absent from
           the specified date until further notice.  If you specify LAST only,
           you are absent from the current time till the end of the specified
           date.  If you specify both parameters, you are absent from the
           FIRST date till the end of the LAST date.

           To delete your ABSENCE record, specify a LAST date before the
           current date, or any FIRST date.

           To change your existing ABSENCE record, re-issue the ABSENCE
           command.  It is generally best to first delete your ABSENCE record,
           but you may safely update your existing ABSENCE record by
           specifying both FIRST and LAST.

           To display your ABSENCE record, issue the ABSENCE command with no
           parameters.  This is a good candidate for your profile.

Notes:     1. Dates are inclusive (the time on the LAST date is 23:59); but
              see note 4.

           2. Anyone who attempts to mail you when you are absent receives one
              of the following messages after issuing the TO command:

              <username> is away from <date> to <date> - continue?
              <username> is away from <date> until further notice - continue?

              The default response is N (No).

              However, if someone mails you by using a CIX script, the message
              is not displayed and the memo is always sent.

           3. Users who send you binary mail (by using the BINMAIL command)
              are not notified of your absence.

           4. Times are held in the ABSENCE record in GMT and adjusted to BST
              (British Summer Time) if necessary.  For example, if you enter:

              ABSENCE FIRST 1/8/91 LAST 25/8/91

              you are absent from 01:00 BST on the 1st of August (00:00 GMT)
              to 00:59 BST on the 26th (23:59 GMT on the 25th).
 ============== add =============
Command:   ADD -- join a new participant to a conference or add a new topic.

Prompt:    Mod:

See also:  REMOVE, NOTE

Format:    ADD PARTICIPANT <username> [<username>...]

Format:    ADD TOPIC

Usage:     When you enter the ADD TOPIC command, CIX prompts you for the name
           of the topic, asks if you want to keep files in the topic, and
           prompts you for the description of the topic.

Note:      Certain topic names are reserved for CIX and cannot be used.
 ============== addpart =============
COMMAND:        ADD PARTICIPANT
PROMPT:         Mod:
SYNTAX:         ADD PARTICIPANT <username> [<userneme>...]
PURPOSE:        Join new participants to a conference or topic?


When you moderate a conference it's useful to be able to add
particiapants yourself. This might be because the conference is
closed, and thus potential participants can't join themselves, or you
might simply want to to start a conference off with a few interested
people.

Some people don't like to be joined to conferences without their
permission, or might only wish to join certain types of conferences.
For this reason every user can compose a note to be displayed to the
moderator telling of their wishes. You should respect the contents of
this note.

See also:  REMOVE, NOTE
 ============== addprompt =============
Add-actions
 
After typing in the text of your message, you have the following options:
   Add.................Add the text as a message (or comment) and 
                       clear your scratchpad.
   CLear...............Clear your scratchpad and return to the Read: prompt.
   COnt................Continue entering the message with the word wrapping
                       entry program, and append new text to the end of the
                       scratchpad.
   Edit................Invoke the text editor to edit or append text.
   Help................Display this message.
   List................Display the contents of the scratchpad.
   Quit................Return to the Read: prompt without adding a message.
                       Your scratchpad will be left intact.
 ============== all =============
read all 
read all quick

     The "all" option of "read" will display all unseen messages in all
conferences you are a member of. The "quick" option makes "read all" not
display the "Comments" lines of the headers

FILE READ ALL ; send all new messages to your scratchpad
Mail: FILE ALL ; send all new mail to scratchpad

 ============== allaboutme =============
Command:   ALLABOUTME -- list your billing details.

Prompt:    Main:

Format:    ALLABOUTME

See also:  BILLING

Usage:     ALLABOUTME lists the billing details you supplied to CIX when you
           registered, and a few other items, such as the total number of
           calls you've made to CIX.
 ============== ambiguous =============
Ambiguous command.
An abbreviation is ambiguous if it is a prefix of two different
commands. If using verbose prompts you are told what the commands
are.

If you are abbreviating commands, you must be prepared to change
your habitual abbreviations, when new commands are introduced.
 ============== ameol =============
Ameol Help file

Ameol version 2 is the only officially supported OffLine Reader for CIX.

The minimum system requirements for Ameol2 are Windows 3.1 (running in

Ameol is free to CIX users and is supplied on CD to all new users. 
Existing CIX users can also obtain the CD for free by mailing their name 
and address to brochure@cix.co.uk.

Technical support and general questions should be directed to the 
'ameol.support' conference using the Report facility - select Send Support
Message from the Help menu.

You will always find the latest version of Ameol2 in
ameol.support/files. 

Please join the 'ameol.support' conference for more details.

 ============== ansi =============
COMMAND:        ANSI
PROMPT:         Opt:
SYNTAX:         ANSI N Q                ;Don't use ANSI.
            or  ANSI Y Y Q              ;Use ANSI default codes.
            or  ANSI Y N                ;Use other ANSI codes,
                <codes>                 ;follow the prompts,
                Q                       :see below.
PURPOSE:        Allows ANSI if your terminal supports it.

If your terminal can use ANSI or VT100 codes (for colour and other
attributes), you may use the CIX command OPTION ANSI Y Y Q. (Meaning
Yes, use ANSI codes and Yes, use the default codes.)  This causes CIX
prompts and message headers to stand out from the rest of the text.

To switch off ANSI codes, use the command OPTION ANSI N Q.

Please note that the ANSI option affects only the output from CIX.
You can't put ANSI characters into messages.

To use ANSI codes other than the defaults, use the command OPTION
ANSI Y N. CIX then prompts you for the code it should send before
prompts and message headers:

   PrePrompt code ESC[??m

You should enter only the ?? part, as explained below; CIX
automatically sends the parts of the code which surround your entry.
CIX then prompts you similarly for the code it should send after
prompts and message headers; this code controls the display of text.
Finally, come out of the OPTION command by entering QUIT.

The ANSI attribute codes are:        The ANSI colour codes are:

                                              Foreground   Background

No attributes            0 or null   Black           30           40
High intensity or bold   1           Red             31           41
Underline                4           Green           32           42
Blinking                 5           Yellow          33           43
Reverse                  7           Blue            34           44
                                     Magenta         35           45
                                     Cyan            36           46
                                     White           37           47

Results depend on the capabilities of your terminal; for instance, it
may not support the "underline" code.  Your terminal should ignore any
code it doesn't support.

To combine several values, separate them with a semicolon.  For
instance:

   ;1;33;40   (PrePrompt)  Bright yellow on black
   ;37        (PostPrompt) White on black

These are the default codes which CIX normally uses when OPTION ANSI Y
Y is in effect.  Notice that the first code for each string is null
(the strings start with the semicolon separator).  This means the
"bright" attribute is switched off after prompts and message headers,
so other text is displayed in normal intensity.  (The null code is not
strictly necessary for the PrePrompt code in this instance.)

If you change the codes, these are saved as the default values for
your current CIX session: you cannot revert to the CIX defaults by using
OPTION ANSI Y Y QUIT.  You may still, of course, switch off ANSI codes
altogether by using OPTION ANSI N QUIT.

To set ANSI codes from your profile, you must put them on separate lines,
just as if CIX were prompting you.  For instance:

   OPTION ANSI Y N
   33
   34
   QUIT

 ============== arcscratch =============
Command:   ARCSCRATCH - Compresses your scratchpad

Usage:     This command compresses the contents of your
           scratchpad using the ARC compression system,
           transfering the contents of your scratchpad to a
           'scratchp.arc' file.  You can then download and
           unarc the file locally saving you download and
           online time.

Example:   From Main: prompt type    arcscratch
             you will receive the message

           Arcing... (to abort ^X^X^X)
           .....
           Archived Scratchpad is **** characters
           Your scratchpad has been deleted
           Main:

Notes:     Try this command with a small file first to
           ensure it's compatible with your copy of ARC!
           Arcing is extremely CPU intensive and will
           affect other users negatively.  If you have MNP5
           (recommended), don't ARC, please!

           Once you have downloaded your archived scratchpad
           you will receive the message

           OK to delete the downloaded scratchpad-file?
           (y/n)?

Usage:     If you already have an archived scratchpad file
           and you attempt to create another archive
           scratchpad then the old one will be deleted.

Example :  Main:arcscratch
           Removed old ARChive
           Arcing... (to abort ^X^X^X)
           .....
           Archived Scratchpad is **** characters
           Your scratchpad has been deleted
           Main:

           When you log off you will be given the
           opportunity to delete your archived scratchpad

Example:   Main:bye
           OK to delete your scratchpad.arc? (y/n)? y
           sthorn, you have been online 3:39 on ttya1
           Goodbye from CIX     !!!HANGUP NOW!!!

Notes:     If you have downloaded your archived scratchpad,
           then it's a good idea to delete it.  No charges
           are made for storage, so we do ask you delete
           your archived scratchpad before you log off.
           When you have downloaded your archived scratchpad
           you will be asked if you wish to delete it, and
           also again before you log off.

 ============== author =============
Alastair Mayer was largely responsible for the original system architecture
and most of the original code.
Peter Jaspers-Fayer coded the 'help' routine, and Bob McQueen coded
the (original) verbose editor (with subsequent modifications by Greg 
Blair and A. Mayer).
Overall system outline, and user interface design, was a collaboration
between A. Mayer, B. McQueen, P. Jaspers-Fayer and Carl Mohan, who 
also wrote the users manual.
The suggestions and complaints of the early users are also acknowledged.

Subsequent devolpment (COSY 3) was also largely done by Alastair Mayer,
with additional coding by Tom Smith and Keith Winter.  Tom Smith is
also responsible for automating several of the system manager functions,
and the 'verbose' interface for the new editor.
Again, the suggestions of users are acknowledged, as are the efforts of
Bob McQueen, who 'ran interference' for us software gnomes.
The current editor is based on one presented in Kernighan and Plauger's
book, "Software Tools in Pascal", but rewritten in 'C'.  The KERMIT file
transfer utility was developed at Columbia University.

People who have worked on the code (in greater or smaller amount) at CIX:

Terry Thompson
DJ Walker Morgan
Frank Thornley
Anders Heerfordt
Giles Todd
Pete Bentley
Mike Rogers
Dave Johnson
Gordon Hundley
Matthew Sims
Paul Gardner
 ============== autorecent =============

COMMAND:        AUTORECENT
PROMPT:         Opt:
SYNTAX:         AUTORECENT YES | ON
PURPOSE:        Join a conf and skip to user defined date/message no.

In conjunction with the RECENT command you can arrange for only the
last x number of messages to be marked as new. This is particularly
useful when using an OLR (offline reader), when rejoining a busy
conference.

AUTORECENT should be set up in your profile - without it the RECENT
command won't work automatically.

/* AUTORECENT help file updated 26/3/93 */

 ============== backward =============
read backward [ <number> [ to <number> ]] 
 
    The "backward" option of "read" allows you to reverse the order in which
the messages are normally displayed.  
 
    To resume reading in the forward direction, use the "forward" command.
 ============== billing =============
Online billing
--------------

To avoid drowning you (and us) in itemised bills, we have an online billing
system.  This allows you to get the previous 3 month's bills and a bill for
the present month up to 4:30am today.

The commands are: BILLING, FILEBILLING.

Getting an itemised bill
------------------------

At the Main: prompt, enter BILLING.  CIX asks you if you want the bill in
ascii (continuous output, for logging to a disk file) or paged (for perusing
online).  Once you have selected A or P, CIX then asks you for a month.  Just
press the return key for the present month, or enter the month name, e.g., Jan
Feb Mar Apr May etc.  CIX then asks you for a year; again, just press return
for the present year.  The bill will then be displayed, itemised for every
login.

To write the bill to your scratchpad instead of to your terminal, enter
FILEBILLING.  CIX then prompts you for the month and year.
 ============== binmail =============
COMMAND:        BINMAIL
PROMPT:         Mail:
SYNTAX:         BINMAIL <username> <filename>
PURPOSE:        Send a file from your directory to another user.

BINMAIL is one of the most useful commands on CIX. It allows you to
send files from your personal directory to that of any other user.
These files can be anything at all - text, source code, complete
programs etc. Files are stored in users binmail directories until their
timestamp (you can see this when you use the DIR command) is more than
30 days old.

BINMAIL is not for sending Binary files in mail message out of CIX, 
across the internet. It is an internal to CIX thing only. Please see 
HELP EXTERNALMAIL for information on how to send a binary file outside 
CIX.

It is principally used in order to make downloading at the other end
simple, or when the text file involved is rather larger than can
comfortably be taken in at one reading.

You are not notified on receiving BINMAIL so it's a good idea to send
a MAIL message too, to let the recipient know the fact that they have
received something, and the name of the file sent.

From the Mail prompt:
BINMAIL <username> <filename> : send private file to user
DIR                           : show private files
FUL                           : upload private file(s)
FDL <filename>                : download private file(s)
ERAse <filename>              : erase private file(s)
REName <oldname> <newname>    : rename private file
FAL <filename>                : list contents of .ARC or .ZIP file
EXPORT <filename>             : copy private file to conference topic

Sequence to send binary mail:
MAIL                          : to enter mail system
DIR                           : to check the filename
FUL                           : to upload private file(s)
BINMAIL <user> <filename>     : to send the file
MAIL <user>                   : Tell the recipient what you've sent

Sequence for receiver:
MAIL                          : to enter mail system
DIR                           : to see received files
FDL <filename>                : to download file(s)
ERAse <filename>              : to delete file(s)
 ============== break =============
The "cancel command" or "interrupt character" is ^X.
Previously it has been ^\ or ^|.

Most actions can be aborted with ^X, but the utility
is not made fail-safe, which means that strange effects
may infrequently result.

Of course in the full screen editor ^X is used to
move the cursor down.

 ============== buddy =============
OPT BUDDY N Q ; turn off buddy help

 ============== bye =============
Command:   BYE -- Terminate your CIX session.

Prompts:   Main:  Read:  Mail:

Format:    BYE

See also:  LOGIN

Usage:     When you have finished your CIX session, enter "bye".  If there is
           unread mail in your Inbasket, CIX asks you if you still want to log
           off.  If you have a scratchpad and/or an arc'd scratchpad, CIX asks
           you if you want to delete it.

Note:      If you want to retain your connection to CIX, so you may log in to
           another account, use instead the LOGIN command at the Main: prompt.
 ============== cancel =============
The "cancel command" or "interrupt character" is ^X.
Previously it has been ^\ or ^|.

Most actions can be aborted with ^X, but the utility
is not made fail-safe, which means that strange effects
may infrequently result.

Of course in the full screen editor ^X is used to
move the cursor down.

 ============== chat =============
Command:   CHAT - allows you to listen and talk to other
           users without using mail messages or conferences
           messages.

Usage:     Lets you listen and talk to other users who are
           online at the same time as you, without using
           mail messages or conferences messages.

Example:   From Main:  prompt type    chat on
                Read:  prompt type    chat on
                Mail:  prompt type    chat on
                Option: prompt type   chat on

           This will turn 'chat on' for your current CIX
           session only.  If you always want to listen for
           Chat, add 'chat on' to your profile.

           CHAT ON will read your incoming chat, allowing
           people to say they want to chat with you or pass
           you a message.  The system will always check what
           messages are waiting before you are due to make
           enter a command at a prompt.  It will not
           interrupt you if you are 'doing' something like
           reading a message or typing a reply.  Chat
           'buts-in' like this

           *CHAT*
           .
           .   The messages you have received
           .
           *ENDCHAT*

           If nothing is waiting, Chat will stay quiet.

           Chat messages

           There are two varieties of Chat messages

           *username*:  is paging you for a chat
           *username*:  is now only listening

           These are 'system' messages.  The first one
           appears before a user can send you his first chat
           message.  It is usually followed by his first
           message.  The second message appears when a user
           has been talking to you but has now stopped.

           <username>:  message

           This is a message the user (username) has typed.

           Talking to another user

           To enter into conversation, type from the prompt,
           CHAT.  A list of users who are online (but who
           may or may not be listening) appears on your
           screen.  You may type in the name of one of them
           or press return, which redisplays an updated
           version of the list.  Once you have entered a
           name, the system will try and put you through.
           If they are not listening or not logged on, you
           will be told that they are not available, and you
           will be returned to the prompt where you entered
           CHAT.  If you are responding to a paging message,
           you can just type CHAT username, which will put
           you through, unless the user has disconnected.

           In Chat mode the prompt is

           >

           (* There is no prompt in terse mode)

           at which you may type any message.  Once you
           press RETURN, the message will be sent to the
           user you are talking to.

           Every 10 seconds or so, the system will check for
           incoming messages and print them on your screen.

           This may break up the line you are typing, but do
           not worry, it is still complete in CIX's memory.
           If you use a communications program which has a
           CHAT mode, switch it on.  These modes usually
           split your terminal screen and make it easier to
           type messages.  See your programs documentation
           for more details.  (Procomm and Telix both have
           chat modes).

           You have a number of commands you may use in chat
           mode.  They are all preceded by the / character.
           They can also be abbreviated to one charatcter eg
           /help or /h.

           /noecho
           Will disable CIX from echoing back what you type.
           (note that this mode is AUTOMATICALLY turned back
           on when you quit chat)

           /echo
           Will reanable echoing.

           /help
           Displays a quick list of commands.

           /quit
           Allows you to leave chat.  When you leave, it
           sends a message to whoever you were talking to
           that you are now only listening.  BUT remember
           that you will continue to recieve chat until you
           either disconnect or type chat off.

           /also username
           Also sends any message you type to that username
           as well as whoever you are already chatting to.
           eg.  You are chatting to fred, and bill pages you
           for a chat.  Type /also bill and your messages
           will go to fred and bill, but note that unless
           fred also type /also bill and bill types /also
           fred, fred and bill won't be able to hear each
           other...

           /xclude username
           Opposite of /also command, it stops sending
           messages to that username.

           /list
           Show's the list of people to whom your messages
           are going to.

           /who
           Shows you who is online

           /resume username
           Shows you username's resume.... eg:/resume fthorn

           /msg username message
           Sends a private message to username.  This
           message is ONLY sent to that user.  When it
           arrives, it is denoted as a private message,
           because instead of the <name>:  identifier, it
           appears as >name<:  .

           If you just press return with a blank line,
           nothing is sent BUT your incoming chat will be
           checked.

           After you /quit , you will continue listening
           until you type CHAT OFF.

IMPORTANT :  WHEN IN CHAT MODE AUTO DISCONNECT IS DISABLED!
             ==============================================
 ============== checkpoint =============
Command:   CHECKPOINT -- Writes your current message pointers to disk

Prompts:   Main:  Read:

Format:    CHECKPOINT

See also:  STORE, RESTORE

Usage      Basically, store doesn't store your CURRENT message pointers, it
           backs up the message pointers that are stored on disk. 

           This is because, to increase speed, when you log in CIX loads your 
           pointers off disk into memory and as you read message or join and 
           resign conferences the pointers are changed in memory and NOT 
           written to disk. Therefore when you use a STORE command CIX backs 
           up your pointers stored on disk, not the changed ones in memory. 

           This is what the CHECKPOINT command is for, it writes your CURRENT 
           message pointers (stored in memory) to disk so when you do a STORE 
           the message pointers you expected were backed up.
 ============== cixtest =============
Command:   CIXTEST -- test the communication path between your terminal and
           CIX

Prompt:    Main:

Format:    CIXTEST

Usage:     CIX presents you with the following menu:

                          M E N U
                1)  Loopback received characters
                2)  Redisplay results from 1)
                3)  Display  one received character  as hex and ASCII
                4)  Display many received characters as hex
                5)  Send XON
                6)  Send XOFF
                7)  Send received hex value as one character
                8)  Send all 256 possible characters
                9)  Quit
               10)  Send lots of text output (with XON/XOFF flow control)
               11)  Send received hex values as characters
            Choice?
 ============== clear =============
COMMAND:        CLEAR
PROMPT:         Mail:
SYNTAX:         CLEAR INBASKET [FROM number][TO number][QUICK]
                CLEAR OUTBASKET [FROM number][TO number][QUICK]
PURPOSE:        Tidy up your in or out mailbaskets.

If you have a lot of mail your mailbox soon becomes rather full. After
several days CIX automatically deletes old mail from your mailbox,
but it's a good idea to get rid of your unwanted correspondence
voluntarily.

Don't forget you can use the FILE command to copy mail messages to
your scratchpad for subsequent downloading if there's anything you
need to retain for the future.

The clear command allows you to quickly tidy up your mail baskets.It
will display all the "Read" messages and ask you whether you want to
delete them or not.The syntax is;

        CLEAR INBASK            Clear read messages in inbasket
        CLEAR OUTBASK           Clear read messages in outbasket

By appending the word QUICK to this command, it will automatically
delete ALL Read messages. ie CLEAR INBASK QUICK.

You can also specify a range of messages to be tidied and worked on
for example;

        CLEAR INBASKET FROM 621000 TO 623000 QUICK

This would delete all read mail messages in the inbasket from mail
message 621000 to mail message 623000 and it would NOT confirm each
deletion

        CLEAR OUTBASKET FROM 623000

This would delete all read mail messages from the outbasket from mail
message 623000 to the last mail message and would ask for confirmation
of each deletetion.


 ============== colour =============
OPT ANSI Y Y Q ; turns on colours in CIX.
You will have to set your terminal to accept ANSI codes.

TO set other colours than default do
OPT ANSI Y N
33
34
Q
It won't work if put on a single line, unfortunately.

This will result in ESC[33m being sent before the prompt,
and ESC[34m being sent after the prompt.

Default settings are ;1;33;40 and ;37, resulting in these codes being sent:
Before prompt ESC[;1;33;40m Bright Yellow on Black
After  prompt ESC[;37              White  on Black

The ANSI colour codes are something like this:
           Foreground       Background
Black           30             40
Red             31             41
Green           32             42
Yellow          33             43
Blue            34             44
Magenta         35             45
Cyan            36             46
White           37             47
To combine several values, separate with  ';'
5;30;47 Blinking Black on White
4;33;44 Underlined Yellow on Blue

The ANSI attribute codes are something like this:
1 High intensity
4 Underline
5 Blinking
7 Reverse

 ============== comment =============
comment

   If there is a message that you want to comment on, then, after you
have read the message, you can type "comment". CIX/CoSy will then put you
into the 'text gobbler' where you can type your comment (finish entry
of your comment with a full-stop, after which you will be at the
Add/Action: prompt where you may add, edit or discard your message).

   The difference between saying and commenting is that when you
comment, a pointer to your new message is added to the message you
were commenting on. These pointers are automatically followed when you
are reading messages by "reference" mode (see 'read ref').

(Note, if you already have text in your scratchpad, then you will be
put straight into the editor)


 ============== comms =============
There have been recent questions about making your modem go as fast 
as possible.

You need a number of things to ensure fast downloads.

1: Zmodem (or Ymodem-G but lets not confuse things) as a file
transfer protocol. If you have an error correcting modem (MNP1-5 or
V42 - bis) then ensure the data compression is turned on

2: RTS/CTS. Sometimes called hardware handshaking, or flow control,
whatever it is turn it on. You will often find this under the Terminal
Options section of your comms package setup. You should also check your
cable is capable of doing rts/cts. Pins 4 and 5 handle this but and
will either be crossed 4 to 5 and 5 to 4 or will be straight though.
How can you tell if yours need to be crossed or straight though, if
pins 2 and 3 are crossed then so should pins 4 and 5.

3: An Unclogged PC. It easy to clog up a PC, just run a program which
steals interrupts. If downloading within windows you may have problems,
watch out for running a mouse driver on the same serial port you use 
the modem with. I've even heard of people having problems with the Keyb 
program in Dos 5.

4: The rest. There are various other little things to do with the modem
many of which are diagnostic and will help you find where things are
going wrong, or at least cut out the complications. 

a) Ensure you have the modem set to tell you what speed you have
connected at, as well as if you got error correction and data
compression.   
b) Ensure you have the modem set to connect at its fastest speed (up to
v.32bis - 14,400). 
c) If you have trouble connecting, tell the modem not to scan for a
speed, ie connect at the fastest speed possible and don't bother to try
any others. Usually ATN0   <- thats a zero BTW.
d) If you are having problems with connecting at fast rates, try
dialling from the terminal using ATDT<phone number>, instead of using the
dialling directory.
 ============== comod =============
Command:   COMOD -- add another moderator to the current conference.

Prompts:   Mod:  Read:

Format:    COMOD <username>

See also:  EXMOD
 ============== conditions =============
The latest set of Terms and Conditions for everyone using CIX Conferencing
can be found in cix:cixnews/reference:26 or at 
http://web.conferencing.co.uk/includes/terms-2.4.htm.
 ============== confstat =============

Command:    GO CONFSTAT or RUN CONFSTAT

Prompt:     Main:

Confstat is a conference statistic program, it provides the following          
information:


*	Creation Date
*	Moderator Name(s)
*	Number of Participants
*	Number of Topics
*	Number of Messages in Total
*	Last Message Date

NOTE:  If you are at the Main: or Mail: prompt, then you will be prompted for
       a conference name to display the statistics on.  If you are the Read:
       prompt, then the program will assume you want statistics on the 
       conference you are currently in.

You will then be prompted to either press <CR> for statistics on topics,
or q will quit at this point.

Topc Statistics include:

*	Topic Name
*	Number of Messages
*  	Number of Files
*	Last Msg Date
*	Activity  Rating (100 - Very active, 1 - Very quiet)
*	Number of messages posted in the last 24 hours. (Max. 100)
* 	Number of messages posted in the last 7 days.  (Max. 100)

The Busyness rating is calculated by getting the date of the last 100 messages,
for each message that is posted within the last ten days, the rating will
increase by a factor of 1.


 ============== cookie =============
COOKIE
	from Main: will display a "word of wisdom" from the closed
	conference "Epithets"
 ============== copy =============
copy <message number> TO  <conference> <topic>

      Message number = the number of the message to be copied, 

      Conference     = The name of the conference where the message is
                       to be added

      Topic          = The topic name if the conference contains more
                       than one topic.

 
 ============== crash =============
If your conference list gets corrupted, type RESTORE at the main
prompt. This will restore your conference list to the way it was at the
start of the day.

Related command: STORE.

 ============== create =============
 To create a new conference, use
    MODerate New <conference name>

 To create (send) a letter, use
    MAil Send
 ============== date =============

COMMAND:        DATE
PROMPT:         Read:
SYNTAX:         READ DATE <date> [ to DATE <date> ]
PURPOSE:        Find and read messages by date.

DATE is an option of READ, used for accessing conference entries by
date of entry, or since a certain date. The date must be entered
without intervening spaces between the day, month, and year,
and with the month in alphabetic form.
The month may be abbreviated if the abbreviation is not ambiguous.

Valid date formats:
   23jun94  = 23 June 1994
   27f1999  = 27 Feb. 1999

Incorrect formats:
   20/11/92  -- date contains slashes
   12ju94    -- is month 'June' or 'July' ?
   91Dec2    -- order should be day, month, year
   Feb 5, 97 -- mustn't contain spaces

Example: READ DATE 23JUN99 TO DATE 25AUG99

/* DATE help file updated 16Feb1999 */


 ============== dejavu =============
If you read by reference, and quit from the topic without reading
all new messages, then you are likely to reread some of the messages
from that topic.
 ============== delete =============
At the Mail: prompt
   DELETE will delete your last read message.
   The "delete ####" command will delete all entries for message "####"
   from your 'Out-Basket'.  The message remains in the system, however,
   until read and deleted by the recipient(s).

To delete a private file type ERA <filename>
To delete a topic file as a moderator type ERA <filename> from read prompt.

 ============== download =============
download
--------  
Main/Read Subsystem:
    In the 'main' or 'read' subsystem, "download" is used to transfer a file
    from your COSY scratchpad to your micro (for local processing or whatever).
    The COSY scratchpad can be filled using the FILE command.

    If you have an archived scratchpad (see the ARCSCRATCH command), download
    will ask you if you want to download that copy. Answer no and you can
    download the ASCII version.


download <protocol>
-------------------
Option Subsystem:
    In the 'option' subsystem, you can define the transfer protocol to use
    when downloading files.   Currently available are:

         download kermit
         download xmodem
         download crc-xmodem
         download ymodem
         download zmodem (default)

   Note : Ymodem is actually Ymodem batch, so when you use this, always
   select Ymodem BATCH as your terminal protocol, otherwise, it will 
   'hold on' for 5 minutes after the download

Similar commands:
Read: FDL <filename>  ;download file from topic
Mail: FDL <filename>  ;download private file
OPT UNIX Y Q          ;select LF line termination in downloaded file
More on downloading see FILES

 ============== echo =============
echo <text>
 
The "echo" command is available at the main level of COSY, but its main
use is within "profile" files.  It causes everything on the rest of the
line to be "echoed" to your terminal.  Thus, in your profile it can be
used to put headers in front of status displays, or to display a
constant 'reminder message' whenever you log on.
 ============== edit =============
Command:   EDIT -- edit a file.

Prompts:   Main:  Read:  Mail:

Format:    EDIT [SCRATCHPAD]
              edit your scratchpad.  This is the default filename.

           EDIT PROFILE
              edit your profile.  Your profile contains commands which are
              automatically issued when you logon to CIX.

           EDIT RESUME
              edit your resume.  Your resume contains anything you wish to say
              about yourself.  Other users may see your resume by issuing
              "SHOW RESUME <nickname>".

           EDIT WORKFILE
              (at the Read: prompt) edit the conference workfile.  The
              workfile may be jointly changed by any conference member.
              Uses might include a working paper.

           EDIT HELP
              obtain a summary of the above commands.

Note:      For a description of the commands you may use in the editor, enter
           HELP VED, HELP FSE or HELP QED (for the verbose, fullscreen and
           quiet editors respectively).
 ============== edit.cmds =============
The "edit" command has the following options:

SCRAtchpad.... edit your scratchpad (assumed if no option given to "edit").
PROfile....... edit your log-on profile.
Resume........ edit your resume file.
Workfile...... edit the workfile for the conference you are in.
SEt........... set default editor (CIX prompts for verbose or quiet).

For a description of the commands you may use in the editor, enter HELP VED,
HELP FSE or HELP QED (for the verbose, fullscreen and quiet editors
respectively).
 ============== editor =============
There are several editors:
Textgobbler default ; a linewrapping (garbling) editor, without possibility
                     to go back to previous lines.
Textgobbler A      ; a non wordwrapping (non garbling) editor,
                    .r redisplays last line
                    .d deletes last line
Terse editor       ; a line editor
Verbose editor     ; a line editor
B editor           ; a full screen editor with WordStar commands
C editor           ; a full screen editor based on Micro Emacs

HELP EDITORB will provide the commands for editor B
HELP EDITORC will provice the commands for editor C
 ============== editorb =============
To select the fullscreen editor, enter:

   OPTION EDIT A QUIT  for text gobbler A and the fullscreen editor.
   OPTION EDIT B QUIT  for the fullscreen editor only.

Enter HELP GOBBLER for information on the "A" text gobbler.  If you SAY a
message with "EDIT B" in effect, you should (for the convenience of other
users) enter TITLE: at the beginning of the top line.

You may define your terminal type to CIX by entering
OPTION TERMINAL TYPE <type> QUIT, where <type> is ANSI, VT52, VT100 or TVI920.
The default is VT100.

The commands for the fullscreen editor are as follows.  For instance, when
you've finished entering your text, hold down the Control key and press K
followed by D.  As well as the cursor left, right, up and down commands shown,
you may use the cursor arrow keys (which you can't in the text gobblers).
Note that ^H (to delete a character) is the code sent by the Backspace key.
(Your OPTION TERMINAL ERASE setting is ignored by the fullscreen editor.)

^S  - Cursor left  *                   ^V -  Toggle overtype/insert mode  *
^D  - Cursor right  *                  ^G -  Delete char at cursor position  *
^E  - Cursor up  *                     ^H -  Delete char to left of cursor  *
^X  - Cursor down  *                   ^T -  Delete word to right of cursor
^A  - Cursor word left  *              ^Y -  Delete line  *
^F  - Cursor word right  *
^QS - Cursor to beginning of line  *   ^QF - Find text in file
^QD - Cursor to end of line  *         ^L  - Find next occurrence
^R  - Page up a screen  *              ^QA - Find and replace text
^C  - Page down a screen  *
^W  - Scroll screen up one line        ^KB - Mark beginning of a block
^Z  - Scroll screen down one line      ^KK - Mark end of block
^QR - Top of file                      ^KC - Copy block to current position
^QC - Bottom of file                   ^KV - Move block to current position
                                       
^KQ - Abort  *                         ^U -  Toggle help off/on  *
^KD - Save the file and exit  *        ^O -  Redefine commands *

You may redefine those commands which are marked with an asterisk (*).  You
cannot save any changes you make to the commands; the default commands will be
in effect the next time you use the editor.  To redefine a command, ensure the
help section is toggled on (^U), then:

   ^O to enter redefinition mode
      move cursor to command
      <CR> to start redefining command
      hit key(s) for new definition
      <CR> to end new definition
      repeat for other commands
   ^O to end

The screen size is set to 24 x 80 irrespective of the terminal pagelength and
width settings.  If your terminal type is VT100 (the default), the editor
defines a scrolling region; if your terminal has more than 24 lines, you will
need to clear the scrolling region when you come out of the editor.  If you're
using a VT100 emulator with a menu line on line 24, you should disable this.

We recommend you use an error-correcting modem (V.42bis or MNP) and hardware
handshaking with the fullscreen editor, as the editor disables XON/XOFF flow
control to allow ^Q and ^S to be used for commands; also, line noise can
produce some very bad results.

 ============== era =============
Command:   ERA -- erase a file from a topic.

Prompt:    Read:

Format:    ERA <filename>

See also:  REN, ERASE

Usage:     ERA allows the moderator to erase a file in a topic.  You may use
           "*" wildcards in the filename; if you do, for each file that
           matches the pattern, CIX gives you a Y/N prompt.

Note:      You may not use the ERASE command for this purpose; ERASE deletes
           files from your private directory.
 ============== erase =============
Command:   ERASE -- erase a file from your private directory.

Prompt:    Mail:

Format:    ERASE <filename>

See also:  BINMAIL, RENAME, EXPORT

Usage:     You may use "*" wildcards in the filename; if you do, for each file
           that matches the pattern, CIX gives you a Y/N prompt.

Note:      Moderators may use the ERA command at the Read: prompt to delete a
           file from a topic.
 ============== exmod =============
Command:   EXMOD -- remove another moderator from the current conference.

Prompts:   Mod:  Read:

Format:    EXMOD <username>

See also:  COMOD
 ============== export =============
Command:   EXPORT -- export a binmail file to a conference.

Prompt:    Mail:

Format:    EXPORT <filename>

See also:  BINMAIL, FUL

Usage:     EXPORT copies a file from your private mail directory to a
           conference topic.  You must have entered the MAIL command from the
           Read: prompt, so CIX knows to which topic you wish to EXPORT the
           file.  You could enter SHOW CURRENT to remind yourself of the
           topic to which you're currently joined.  When you have EXPORTed a
           file, you may delete it from your directory by using the ERASE
           command.

           Please remember to mail the conference moderator, so s/he may add
           the file to the flist.
 ============== externalmail =============
As a CIX user you have access to INTERNET MAIL, this means you can mail
people on different computers all around the world. 

To mail someone on a different site type MAIL TO user@site. To get
someone to mail you on CIX, tell them your mail address is you CIX
nickname @cix.compulink.co.uk, so if you nickname was johnperry, your
Internet mail address would be johnperry@cix.compulink.co.uk which you
can print on your business cards for a bit of extra kudos.

Finding the address you want to mail to
---------------------------------------
Unfortunately there is not at present an easy way to get a list of users
who can be contacted for a couple of reasons. Firstly there are
millions of people, and secondly they are changing all the time..

If you know that someone has an email address and you know which site
they are on then sending a mail message to postmaster@site asking what
the email address for the person you are trying to get hold of, will
come up with the answer you want.

If you are not sure, or don't know the site then there is a way to find
this out as well. From one of the CIX prompts type: GO INTERNET and you
should find yourself at the ip> prompt from here you can use the WHOIS
program to get information of Internet sites. Type:

whois Smith             - looks for name or handle SMITH.
whois \!SRI-NIC         - looks for handle SRI-NIC only.
whois '.Smith, John'    - looks for name ``John Smith'' only.
whois '*BT*'            - looks for anything with BT in is....

You can then send a mail message off to postmaster@site asking what a
persons username is.

The easiest way is to phone up the person you want to mail and ask them
what there mail address is :-) This is of course not always practical.

Some example addresses
----------------------
Here is a list of networks which you may find useful as examples, please
note, these are not guarenteed to work and may change without us
knowing. If anyone knows one is wrong, or doesn't work, please let me
(mat@cix.compulink.co.uk) know and I'll try to get the correct address.

Network		Mail to
CompuServe	1234.12345@compuserve.com   (note, replace the , in the
                                             normal CI$ address for a .)
MCI Mail	user@mcimail.com
             or 123-1234@mcimail.com        (note, mcimail Id's may not

					    Exchange
EARN/BITNET	user@site.bitnet            You must replace user and site.

Thats it so far, if you think a mail address may be useful, please let
me know.. mat@cix.compulink.co.uk..

Sending binary files via External mail
--------------------------------------
You cannot send binary files using External Mail, what people do to get
 around this is to take your binary file and convert it to ASCII, send
the  mail message and the person at the other end will have to convert
it back to a binary file. The program you need to turn a binary into a
ASCII file  is called UUENCODE and the one to turn it back to being a
binary again is UUDECODE. 

You will find the UUencode/UUdecode package for the PC in the filepool
conference.  For other machines you should look in the platforms file
list.  The file is UUEXE521.ZIP, use it as follows:  

1: uuencode <binaryfile>
2: Log into CIX
3: From the Main: prompt Type: UPLOAD < and upload the ASCII file you 
   created with UUENCODE
4: Once you get back to the Main: prompt Type: MAIL TO <user>@<site>
5: CIX will ask you for a subject, enter the subject of your mail message.
6: CIX will tell you that you already have n lines in your scratchpad.
7: You should now exit from the editor and hit <CR> at CIX's send/action:
   prompt to send the mail message.
8: When the person you sent the mail to receives the mail they should
   take the file, remove the header and run the uudecode program over it.
 ============== fal =============
Command:   FAL -- list the files in an .ARC or .ZIP file.

Prompts:   Read:  Mail:

Format:    FAL <filename>

Example:   fal cixman.arc

See also:  FLIST, FDIR, PRIVATE

Usage:     FAL shows which file or files are contained in an .ARC or .ZIP
           file, either in a conference topic or in your private mail
           directory.  At the Read: prompt only, you may use "*" and "?"
           wildcards.  "*" matches one or more characters; "?" matches a
           single character.  For instance, "cix??n.*" might match
           "cixman.arc".  If you use wildcards, FAL lists the directory of the
           first file only which matches the search pattern.
 ============== fax =============

The CIX Faxgateway
------------------

To send a fax via the CIX FaxGateway type:

MAIL TO FAXMACHINE

To send a fax, the first part of your mail message should contain 'Fax control 
codes'.  Here is an example of how to send a fax to 020 8255 5101 for my
attention.                     

% Faxctrl: Faxno=020 8255 5101
% Faxctrl: To=Paul
% Faxctrl: From=Whoever
% Faxctrl: End
This is where you can start putting your Fax text.

The above example will send a fax to 020 8255 5101 with a cover page for the
attention of Paul.  The cover page will also state that it is from 'Whoever'.

If you do not want a cover sheet or want to create your own within the body
of your message, then simply add this control:

% Faxctrl: Cover=N

NB: If you do this, then you should not use the To & From Fax controls.       

Pricing
-------

We have tried to keep the CIX fax price as simple and as inexpensive 
as possible. 

Please note: If your fax is not sent you are not billed, so if you get
the telephone number wrong, or the number is engaged, or even if you mess
up the commands you should not be billed.


These are the prices for faxes sent to a UK telephone number.

Normal Fax:   30 pence per page
Extras:       20 pence per extra per page

Each page consists of 64 lines of text.  If you send a fax without a 
% Faxctrl: Cover=N, then the first page will take 54 lines of text.

The prices for faxes sent outside the UK are even simpler. 

The prices are as follows:

+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| Destination:       | First page:        | Additional pages |
+--------------------+--------------------|------------------+
| Europe:            | 70 pence           | 45 pence         |
| Rest of the World  | 1 pound 75 pence   | 1 pound 25 pence |
+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+


Having problems
---------------

When you have sent a fax, you will receive a mail message from the fax
machine telling you if it was sent okay, how long it took, how much you 
have been charged, the country that the fax was delivered to, the number
of pages, receiving ID, the actual time that the fax was sent and the
speed at which the fax was sent.

If the fax did not go well (ie. the number was engaged) then you will be
told this in the mail message.  Remember, you will not be billed for a 
failed transmission.

If you continue to have problems, put a message in the cix.support
conference about it, or send an email to support@cix.co.uk.

Differences from the previous gateway
-------------------------------------

The current gateway has no concept of different resolutions, and thus many
of the old controls are not supported in this version.

However, should your fax message contain one of the unsupported codes, then
the gateway will ignore them, and your fax should still be delivered ok.

This version has a enormously increased error detection, and instead of      
mailing you with an error code, it should mail you with an actual reason
why your fax could not be transmitted.
 ============== fdir =============
Command:   FDIR -- display a list of the files in a topic.

Prompts:   Mod:  Read:

Format:    FDIR [<topicname>]

See also:  FLIST, FFIND, ORPHANS, DIR

Usage:     FDIR gives you a `raw' list of the files in a topic, without the
           descriptions of the files that FLIST gives you.  FDIR is mainly
           used by the conference moderator when modifying the flist (file
           list), but anyone may use the command.

           If and only if you entered the MODERATE command at the Main:
           prompt, you may specify the topic name.

Notes:     1. A file shown by FDIR is not necessarily available for
              downloading; the moderator must have added a file to the flist
              before it may be downloaded.  However, the moderator may
              download a file without first adding it to the flist.

           2. Use the DIR command to see a list of the files in your private
              (binmail) directory.
 ============== fdl =============
Type HELP FILES

 ============== fexport =============
Command:   FEXPORT -- export a file to the filepool.

Prompt:    Read:

Format:    FEXPORT <filename>

See also:  FILEPOOL, FFIND, EXPORT

Usage:     FEXPORT may be used only by the conference moderator.  

           The file is copied (not moved) to the filepool, so you should
           delete the original file, using the ERA command.  You may include
           in your flist a file that is in the filepool by using a "f|" tag.

           When you FEXPORT a file, you should mail a moderator of the
           filepool conference (enter SHOW FILEPOOL to see who these are), so
           he may include the description of the file in the flist of
           filepool/biglist.  The flist of filepool/thelot is automatically
           updated after a delay of up to 24 hours, but this doesn't contain a
           description.
 ============== ffind =============
Command:   FFIND -- search CIX for a file.

Prompts:   Main: Read:

Format:    FFIND <substring>

See also:  FLIST, FDL, FILEPOOL

Usage:     FFIND searches CIX for files whose names contain <substring>
           (leading and trailing "*" wildcards are assumed).  If you happen to
           know the complete name of the file you're looking for, you may
           specify that.  FFIND then displays the names of the files, their
           sizes, and where they are.

           FFIND searches open and closed conferences, but not confidential
           conferences.  It also searches the filepool.  (A moderator may put
           a file in the filepool by using the FEXPORT command.)  If a file is
           in the filepool, you may download it from filepool/thelot (note
           that the filepool conference is distinct from the filepool itself).
           You may also download it from one of the 36 topics in the filepool
           conference which contain subsets of the complete flist.  For
           instance, if the file's name starts with "a", you may download it
           from the "files_a" topic -- this saves time, as CIX has a shorter
           list to scan before starting the download.

Notes:     1. FFIND uses a table which is automatically built each night from
              the directories of conferences and the filepool.  Therefore,
              there is a delay of up to 24 hours between a file being uploaded
              to CIX and it being shown by FFIND.

           2. A file shown by FFIND which is in a conference is not
              necessarily available for downloading; the conference moderator
              must include a file in the flist before you can download it.
              The flists in filepool/thelot, filepool/a_files, etc., are
              automatically updated each 24 hours, though.

           3. To see a description of what a file is, join the conference and
              enter "flist <filename>".  If the file is in the filepool, there
              may be a description in filepool/biglist, provided the moderator
              has manually updated the flist.

           4. A file in the filepool may be available for downloading from a
              conference other than filepool, if the moderator has updated the
              flist accordingly.  (The only thing special about the filepool
              conference is that the flists in some of the topics are updated
              automatically).  These entries are not shown by FFIND; use the
              FLIST command to see entries in a flist.
 ============== file =============
Command:   FILE - Redirects the output of any command to your scratchpad.

Usage:     The prefix command 'file' re-directs the ouput of any command
           to your scratchpad,  where it can be retrieved
           the next time you enter the editor, or it may be downloaded.

Example:   From Main: prompt type   file show participants
                Main: prompt type   file read all

see also:  SHOW, SCRATCHPAD, DOWNLOAD
 ============== filepool =============
The FILEPOOL is a repository for all files on cix which may have relevance 
to more than one conference. Any conference moderator can include any of 
the filepool files on the flist of any topic without having to have a copy 
of the file in the local directory.

The filepool conference is a convenient place to find all files that reside 
in the FILEPOOL.

Files for submission to the filepool should be uploaded to the topic 
2newfiles and not fexported to the filepool by users. This will permit all 
uploads to be properly scanned for viruses prior to being released into the 
conference areas.

The filepool conference is divided into five main topics:

    1)    thelot    All files which are currently found by ffind
    ============    as being in the FILEPOOL are downloadable by
                    anyone here. No comments or descriptions are
                    provided.

    2)    biglist   All files which have a description known to
    =============   CIX are included on the flist here. If a
                    moderator fexports a file to the FILEPOOL he
                    should mail the filepool moderators with a  
                    description for it to appear here.

    3)     ?_files  There is one topic here for each letter of
    ==============  the alphabet, and one for each digit. These
                    topics are a subset of biglist containing
                    only the file starting with the same letter
                    as the topic name. (i.e. files starting with
                    the letter 'g' are in 'g_files') If you know
                    the initial letter of the file you want to
                    download, it will be quicker to download the
                    file from these topics that from biglist.

    4)   2newfiles  Files should be uploaded here is they are to
    ==============  appear only in the FILEPOOL. Descriptions
                    will be added and the flist will contain all
                    files uploaded in the last month, as well as
                    any uploaded since the last update of the
                    biglist.

    5)    chatter   This topic is the only one where discussion
    =============   of files in the filepool may take place. Any
                    messages posted to any of the other topics
                    not directly related to that topic will be 
                    moved here at the earliest opportunity.

    6)      about   This topic is reserved for discussion about
    =============   files that are, or perhaps should be in the 
                    filepool. Messages posted here should be to
                    the point and not general discussion. Any
                    idle chatter in this topic will be moved to
                    the chatter topic!
 ============== files =============
Files
-----
Files are held within conference topics. To get a list of
files available in a conference topic, type FLIST.

To download a file, type FDL filename
                         ------------

To upload a file, type FUL filename
                       ------------

Note:
(1) The file transfer protocol used is the same as selected for up/down-
loading your scratchpad
(2) When you have uploaded a file, it must be added to the File List by
the conference moderator, so mail him to inform him that you have uploaded
a file. 

Selecting your up and download protocol
---------------------------------------
From any prompt, type 

OPT DOWN (and press return)
Available protocols are displayed. Select one of them and press return.
then type
QUIT

and you will be back where you were.

For upload protocol selection, the same instructions apply, but use
OPT UP.

If you want to add this to your profile, add a line

OPT DOWN x Q
Where x is the SINGLE character you would enter to select your required
protocol.

Examples:
OPT UP Y Q ; select Ymodem uploads

Related commands:
FFIND <substring>  ; will search for downloadable file *substring*

 ============== filestats =============
Command:    FILESTATS - Shows you the download statistics of files in the
            current topic of a conference.

Usage:      When in a topic of a conference with files, typing RUN FILESTATS
            will display each file's statistics, currently, the last time
            the file was downloaded, and the number of times it has been
            downloaded.  When run, it will inform you of what period the
            statistics started, and the last time they were updated.

Exampe:     join windows/files
	    run filestats  

            Will display the number of times and when each file was last
	    downloaded.


 ============== find =============
Command:   FIND -- display messages containing a word.

Prompt:    Read:

Format:    FIND <pattern> [[FROM] <msgno>] [TO <msgno>]

Example:   find widget 120 to 260

See also:  SEARCH, SQUICK.

Usage:     FIND looks in the current topic for the specified pattern and
           displays the messages which contain the pattern.  The pattern could
           be a word or a part of a word: it may not contain spaces.  You may
           use a question mark as a wildcard character, to match any single
           character.  For instance, "??dget" would match "widget" or
           "gadget".  You could also use a question mark to match a space if
           you wanted to locate two words.  For instance, "ibm?pc" would match
           "IBM PC", provided the words were not split across two lines.

           If you specify only the pattern, FIND scans all messages in the
           topic.  You may limit the search by specifying FROM <msgno> and/or
           TO <msgno>.  You may omit the FROM keyword.  TO <msgno> specifies
           the last message to be scanned (the range is inclusive).

Notes:     1. FIND is case-insensitive: upper-case and lower-case letters
              are treated equally.

           2. The maximum length of the pattern is 14 characters.

           3. FIND scans nicknames in message headers as well as the text of
              messages.

           4. Messages which are displayed by FIND are marked as read in the
              normal way.
 ============== first =============
read first
read first [ to <message-identifier> ]

    "first" is one of several ways of identifying which message you wish
"read" to show you.  It is equivalent to "1".
 ============== flist =============
Command:   FLIST -- display a list of the files in a topic, with brief
           descriptions.

Prompt:    Read:

Format:    FLIST [<filename>]

See also:  FFIND, FILES, FDL, FUL

Usage:     FLIST displays all, or a part of, the file list maintained by the
           conference moderator.  To see a partial list, specify a filename or
           a filename pattern.  In a filename pattern, you may use "?" to
           represent any single character, or "*" to represent one or more
           characters.  For instance, you could enter "FLIST *.ZIP" to get a
           list of all the .ZIP files in the topic.

Note:      You may find it convenient to file the flist in your scratchpad,
           which you may then download and read offline.  Do this by entering
           "FILE FLIST".

Command:   FLIST -- edit the file list.

Prompt:    Mod:

Format:    FLIST [<topicname>]

See also:  SCGET, SCPUT

Usage:     At the Mod: prompt, FLIST allows you to maintain the flist.  If you
           entered the MOD command from the Read: prompt, you must not enter
           the topic name.

           Entries in the flist have the following formats:

           c|<filename>|description
           f|<filename>|description
              A file in the current topic and in the filepool, respectively.

           ||any text
           .|| any text
              Notes visible to participants.  With the second format, the text
              is aligned with the descriptions.

           #||any text
              A note which is visible only to the conference moderator.
 ============== flowcontrol =============
Recommended flowcontrol setting of your modem is:
RTS/CTS handshake.
No XON/XOFF handshake in either direction.
Let XON/XOFF characters pass through modem, dont absorb them.

Recommended flowcontrol setting for your comms package:
RTS/CTS handshake
XON/XOFF when in textmode
(XON/XOFF should automatically be disabled as needed when
doing a file transfer).

 ============== forward =============
read forward [ <number> [ to <number> ]

   The "forward" option causes "read" to resume reading conferences in the 
forward direction.  See "help backward".
 ============== ful =============
Type HELP FILES

 ============== go =============
GO

allows access to several other areas of cix such as newsnet and

 ============== gobbler =============
A `text gobbler' reads the text you key in when you (for instance) comment to
a message or send mail to someone.  CIX uses a text gobbler only when your
scratchpad is initially empty; otherwise it uses a text editor.  If you quit
from entering an earlier comment, for instance, your scratchpad still contains
the comment.  You may clear your scratchpad by issuing the KILLSCRATCH
command.

CIX has two text gobblers.  In the gobblers, you may use the Backspace key to
delete characters (or the Delete key if OPTION TERMINAL ERASE DELETE is in
effect).  You may not use the cursor arrow keys (though you may use them in
the fullscreen editor).

The default text gobbler does wordwrap.  That is, as you approach the end of a
line, it deletes the word you're keying and copies it to the start of a new
line; you don't have to press the Carriage Return key.  The wordwrapping
occurs at 10 characters less than your terminal width setting; that is, at the
69th character on a line if you have the default terminal width setting.  If
you upload text you've prepared offline, you'll probably want to disable
wordwrapping by setting your terminal width to a large value.  For instance,
enter OPTION TERMINAL WIDTH 999 QUIT.

End your input to the default text gobbler by typing "." or ".s" at the
beginning of a line with no characters following (not even a space).

If you change to a different editor, you may revert to the default text
gobbler by entering OPTION EDIT VERBOSE QUIT (or simply OP E V Q).

You get another text gobbler when you use OPTION EDIT A QUIT; this doesn't do
wordwrapping.  If you type past the position defined by your terminal width
setting (79 by default), CIX automatically adds a hyphen and starts a new
line.  You don't see this immediately, but CIX warns you when you next press
Carriage Return.

End your input to the `A' gobbler by typing "." or ".s" at the beginning of a
line, as with the `verbose' gobbler.  Additionally, you may enter the
following commands:

   .r  to redisplay the last line
   .d  to delete the last line
   .q  to quit without saving your input

These commands have no effect on the TITLE: line.  Even if you use the ".q"
command, the TITLE: line will remain in your scratchpad.

Enter HELP VED or HELP FSE for help on the editors (verbose or fullscreen).
 ============== handshake =============
Recommended flowcontrol setting of your modem is:
RTS/CTS handshake.
No XON/XOFF handshake in either direction.
Let XON/XOFF characters pass through modem, dont absorb them.

Recommended flowcontrol setting for your comms package:
RTS/CTS handshake
XON/XOFF when in textmode
(XON/XOFF should automatically be disabled as needed when
doing a file transfer).

 ============== header =============
read header <number> [to <number>

   The "header" option is one way of quickly scanning through a range of
messages.  Only:
                message number
                originator
                number of characters in that message
                date of creation
                -----------------
                the first line of text
is displayed.

    No action is taken if you do not say what to read the header of.
 ============== help =============
help

The "help" command        can be used in three ways:
      help                - if no arguments are given, a list of commands
                            that can be used at this level are given
      <command> ?         - lists valid arguments to <command>
      help <command>      - gives general help on that command
      help hfiles         - lists <commands> for which help is available
      ?                   - lists available commands

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on the syntax declarations:

    The form or syntax of commands and options are often displayed with
the following symbols:

[ optional parmeters ].............modify the behaviour of the command
<text not to be taken literally> ..something appropriate must be substituted

 ============== hfiles =============
abbreviations  crash          handshake      order          show

 ============== internet =============
Command:	GO INTERNET -- Enter the Internet subsystem.

Prompts:	Main: Read: 

Description:

The Internet is a network of computers that stretches around the world. These
connections can be anything from a serial cable to a fibre optic link. Data 
is transmitted down these channels but because of the additional bandwidth 
available, the connected sites allow users to access the connections. 
Basically, they allow us access to this network with the ability to log onto 
any computer that allows you. This opens doors to online databases, file 
servers, online games, chat servers and so on. There are thousands of public 
access, and part public access systems out there..

Once you get into the CIX Internet program you should get an ip> prompt. 
The help options are displayed when you enter the CIX Internet subsystem.
 
You use the telnet program to connect yourself to one of the thousands 
of online services also connected to the Internet, this could be a multi 
user game, a NASA database, a Chat server with hundreds of people on it, 
or the computer in your American office!

You use the FTP program to connect to a file server, with this you can
pull files off, or put file onto other computers, if you have permission
of course. On one of the many public access file servers there will be a
public directory which will have the permissions set to allow you to pull
files off it.

Addressing is similar to the current external mail addressing, except
you telnet or ftp to a site, instead of specifying a username. Sometimes
you will be expected to quote a port number at that site to connect to,
this will run the program associated with that port number, this
normally happens with multi user games. I will put a list of internet
addresses in this topic for download.

Here are a couple of questions you may have, along with the answers.

How much extra does it cost you?    Nothing..
What information is out there?      A very very large amount.
How do you get into it?             Type GO INTERNET from Main: or Read:
How do I find out whats there?      Type ADDRESS <text> where <text> is
                                    something that may interest you.

If you are having problems with the concept of the Internet (quite common 
I assure you) or want more reading material, look in the file list of the
cix/internet conference/topic where you should find some files, zen_txt.zip
(Zen and the Art of the Internet) being one of the best tutorials.
 ============== join =============

COMMAND:        JOIN
PROMPT:         Main: Read: Mail:
SYNTAX:         JOIN <conferencename>
PURPOSE:        Enter a conference, or join a new one.

If you wish to read the contents of a specific conference, just type
join  <conference name>, and you will be joined to your specified
conference. If you have not previously joined this conference or you
have previously resigned from it then you will be asked if you would
like to register.

It isn't necessary to type join to join a conference, just pressing
<cr> will automatically join you to the next conference in your
conference list. Use it to join new conferences. New conferences you
join will be added to the end of your conference list.  See the
ORDER command to change the order you wish to view conferences in.
Also see RECENT and AUTORECENT to choose how many messages in a
conference will be marked as unread when you join.

 ============== kermit =============
OPT UP K Q ; select kermit uploads.
OPT DOWN K Q ; select kermit downloads.

KERMIT was originally developed at Columbia University, and that remains
the central authority and repository for all versions of KERMIT.  The
software is free, although there may be a distribution charge to cover
costs.  It has been implemented on virtually all minicomputers, most
mainframes, and nearly all microcomputers.

CIX kermit supports three byte checksums, long packets, sliding windows,
compression, etc.

Kermit over IP running on a Unix or VMS machine
-----------------------------------------------

For anyone interested kermit over IP, both uploads
and downloads work happily with the following settings (from the kermit
defaults) at your local end.

SET WINDOW 31
SET SEND PACKET 1024
SET BLOCK 3

and don't forget SET FILE TYPE BIN for binary files.

Kermit over IP running on a MSDos machine
-----------------------------------------

 ============== killarc =============
Command:   KILLARC - deletes the contents of your
           archived scratchpad.

Usage:     Deletes the contents of your archived scratchpad.

Example:   From Main:   prompt type   killarc

                 and you will receive the message

                     Arc'ed scratchpad is deleted

Notes:     If you don't use the command 'killarc' you
           will be given the opportunity to delete it when
           you log off using the 'bye' command.

Example:   Main:bye
           OK to delete your scratchpad.arc? (y/n)? Y
           sthorn, you have been online 101:32 on ttya1
           Goodbye from CIX     !!!HANGUP NOW!!!

Notes:     If you don't delete your archived scratchpad it
           will be saved until the next time you log on.  No
           charges are made for storage, so we do ask you
           delete your scratchpad before you log off when
           possible.

see also:  FILE, ARCSCRATCH, SCRATCHSIZE, DOWNLOAD, UPLOAD,
           KILLARC
 ============== killscratch =============
Command:   KILLSCRATCH - deletes the contents of your
           scratchpad.

Usage:     Deletes the contents of your scratchpad.

Example:   From Main:   prompt type   killscratch

                 and you will receive the message

                     scratchpad deleted

Notes:     If you don't use the command 'killscratch' you
           will be given the opportunity to delete it when
           you log off using the 'bye' command.

Example:   Main:bye
           OK to delete your scratchpad? (y/n)? Y
           sthorn, you have been online 101:32 on ttya1
           Goodbye from CIX     !!!HANGUP NOW!!!

Notes:     If you don't delete your scratchpad it will be
           saved until the next time you log on.  No charges
           are made for storage, so we do ask you delete
           your scratchpad before you log off when possible.

           KILLARC
 ============== last =============
read <message-identifier> to last
read last
read backward last [to <message-identifier>]

   "last" is another way of specifying which message you want to read.
It is equivalent to the highest message number in the current topic.
 ============== level =============

COMMAND:        LEVEL
PROMPT:         Mail:
SYNTAX:         LEVEL <0, 1, 2>
PURPOSE:        Change level of HELP

If you are a newcomer to CIX, you may find the LEVEL command useful.

Normally your help level is set to 0, level 1 or 2 provides a menu
of commands available from which ever prompt you are at.

Note: The level command works only from Mail:

See also BUDDY, HELP

/* LEVEL help command updated 26-3-93 */




 ============== login =============
Command:   LOGIN -- login to another CIX account.

Prompt:    Main:

Format:    LOGIN

See also:  BYE

Usage:     LOGIN acts like BYE, but retains your connection to CIX.  CIX then
           writes a new "login:" prompt, where you may enter "cix" or "qix" in
           the normal way.
 ============== logout =============
bye

     The "bye" command will cause CoSy to remember how much of each conference 
you have seen, and disconnect you from the system.

    It is always advisable to enter "bye" before turning off your terminal, as
this ensures that CoSy terminates properly, and saves "where you were".
 ============== macro =============
Main prompt:
MACRO <macroname> <expansion>
This will make macroname a macro that will be expanded whenever it
is typed as a command.
Recursive macros are possible, and make sense if including the TNEXT
command
Example: 
MACRO EXIT BYE
This will make EXIT behave as BYE.

Related commands:
OPTION SYNONYM <oldname> <newname>
OPTION SUBSTITUTE <oldname> <newname>
SHOW OPTION

Here are some example CIX macros:

Skip back a 5 days worth of messages in each of your topics
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is useful when coming back from holiday, or if you use an Offline 
message reader with CIX which has blown up and you have lost a number of 
days worth of messages, and its too late to use the RESTORE command.

From the Main: prompt type:

MACRO goback SKIP TO BACK 5 TNEXT GOBACK

will set you up with a new command called GOBACK (name is optional)
which skips back 5 days in the CURRENT (see next paragraph) topic,
joins the next topic in your conference list and then re runs the
macro.

Because this script never joins a specific topic, you must join a
topic first, preferably the first in your conference list, you can
find this by typeing SHOW, joining the first conference that appears
there and hitting <CR> to join the first topic. Now type GOBACK and
CIX will skip around to the end of your conference list and then
stop.

If you put a HEADER command before the SKIP command in the macro, CIX
will not display the full message is skips to, just the header.

 ============== mail =============
The CIX Mail System

Type:

MAIL <CR>

from the Main: prompt to get into the mail system. From here you can send
private mail to other CIX users, binary private mail and mail to users who
are on other electronic networks around the world.

When you first go into the Mail system, CIX will display your in and out
baskets for you. Press <CR> to display the message at the top of your in
basket on your terminal, or type in a message number to display that 
particular message. Cix mail is only kept in your in basket for 30 days. 

Sending a mail message
----------------------
To send a mail message, from the Mail: prompt type:
TO <user>
to get mail to another user on CIX. Or: 
TO <user@site>
for mail to a user on another electronic network.

Replying to a mail message
--------------------------
To reply to a message, type:
REPLY
after reading the message you want to reply to. Or:
REPLY <msg-no>
to reply to a specific mail message.

Once you have typed one of these commands, CIX will ask for a subject, 
this is just a line that appears in the in and out baskets to help your
and the recipient work out what the message is about without having to 
read the message itself. On a reply the subject line is automatically
the subject line of the original, thought this can be changed using the 
subject command from the Send/action: prompt.

Next, CIX will put you in the text gobbler, you can enter your message 
here, ending with a . as the first character of a new line.

You will now be at the send/action prompt, here you can press <CR> to send
the message, change the subject line, re edit the message because you forgot
something important, copy the message to someone else (called Carbon Copy
or CC) or a couple of other things.

Type:

HELP EXTERNALMAIL   Introduction to sending mail out of CIX, how to 
                    do Internet addressing and sending files by mail.
HELP BINMAIL        for how to send binary files to other CIX users.
HELP MAIL.CMDS      for all the commands from the Mail: prompt.

 ============== main.cmds =============
** Welcome to CIX (based on the CoSy Conferencing system) **

   The novice user should only need to know the four basic commands:

"show" will list all conferences which you are a member of.

"join" will connect you to a conference.  If no conference-name is 
       given, the first conference with unread text will be joined.

"mail" allows you to send electronic mail to another CIX user.

"bye"  terminates your CoSy session.

   For help on any command, enter "help <command-name>".
   For a quick reference on the options of a command enter "<command-name> ?"
   For a list of all available help files, enter "help hfiles"

 ============== markunread =============

COMMAND:        MARKUNREAD
PROMPT:         Mail:
SYNTAX:         MARKUNREAD [<messagenumber>]
PURPOSE:        Marks a mail message unread.

This command allows you to change the status of a message in your
inbasket. The command MARKUNREAD on its own simply toggles the last
mail message you read. If followed by the message number you can
selectively mark mail messages.

/* MARKUNREAD help file updated 26-3-93 */

 ============== mnp =============
MNP MicroCom Network Protocol.

A transparent error correcting protocol. Usually built into the modem.
May be built into the comms program instead.

Main varieties:
MNP2  (just error correction - no linenoise)
MNP5 includes compression, doubles transfer rate with text. No or little
     effect with binary files.

If you have MNP, you should probably set your modem to accept only MNP 
when connecting to CIX, and to drop the line if a MNP-connection is not
achieved (due to linenoise).

 ============== moderate =============
Command:   MODERATE -- maintain a conference.

Prompts:   Main:  Read:  Mail:  Mod:

Format:    MODERATE [NEW] [<confname>]

Usage:     The NEW keyword allows you to create a new conference.  CIX then
           prompts you for the details.

Note:      Some commands available at the Mod: prompt apply to the whole
           conference.  Others (such as FLIST) apply to a particular topic; if
           you intend to use one of these commands, it may be convenient to
           issue the MODERATE command at the Read: prompt.

The following commands are available at the Mod: prompt:

           ?............display a list of available commands
           ADD..........add a participant or topic
           COMOD........add another moderator (also at Read: prompt
           EXMOD........remove another moderator (also at Read: prompt)
           FDIR.........list the files in a topic (also at Read: prompt)
           FLIST........edit the file list
           HELP.........display brief help on the available commands

moderate new
show new

   "moderate new" will create a new conference.  You will be asked for
a list of topics and the initial list of participants.

   "show new" will list all conferences that you are a member of that
have messages that you have not seen.  This is the command that executes
when you first login to CoSy.
 ============== newsnet =============
Newsnet can be accessed by typing GO NEWSNET at the Main: prompt. 


 ============== next =============
Read: TNEXT
Goes to next topic in list, (which could be in another conference) 
irrespective of topic activity, not marking messages read

Read: TPREV
Goes to previous topic in list, (could be in next conference) 
irrespective of topic activity, not marking messages read 

Read: NEXT
Goes to next active topic in list, (could be in next conference) 
marking all messages read in current topic.

 ============== nickname =============
For those who want to change their nickname, please note the following-

  * Make sure the new nickname is not currently in use. If a nickname
is in use, or has previsouly been used, it cannot be used again.
(Exceptions can be made in the case of people wanting their own old
nicknames back.)

  * Be aware that any e-mail sent to the old nickname cannot be
auto-forwarded on. Make sure to let people who are likely to e-mail
you know of the change.. BEFORE it happens.

  * Be sure, also, to let any moderators of closed conferences you are
in know of the change before it happens. They will need to be aware of
the new nickname in their conference.

  * Conferences that you are currently a moderator of will require
particular attention.

Bearing all this in mind mail cixadmin with details of what you require
for the new name etc. and they will help arrange it for you.

 ============== note =============
Command:   NOTE -- edit the conference note or personal note.

Prompt:    Mod:

Format:    NOTE

Usage:     NOTE allows you to enter or edit the conference note.  The
           conference note (if any) is displayed in response to a
           SHOW <confname> command, following the list of topics.

Prompt:    Main:

Format:	   EDIT NOTE

Usage:     Your NOTE is displayed when a moderator adds you as a  
           participant to a conference. It allows you to inform a 
           moderator of your wishes regarding joining conferences.
 ============== olr =============
What is Blinking?

This is the term used to describe someone logging onto CIX, downloading all
their new messages and logging off again. The CIX messages can be read
offline and perhaps replies to some messages can be created which can then
be uploaded to CIX in a bundle.

Blinking has taken off in the past couple of years with people using
programs called OffLine Readers (OLR's) to handle all the messing around.
There are OLR's for many computers and many operating systems, a list
follows:

System     Program        Contact            Support Conference

Archimedes ReaderS        vulch    	     <unknown>

Windows	   Matwin         dcraggs  	     matrix/matwin
Windows    Virtual Access ashmount     	     ashmount

I hope I haven't missed any out, if I have, please let me know (mat@cix)

The idea of an OLR is to take the pain out of reading and replying offline.
Most OLR's use simple scripts written in a comms package script language to
handle the fileing and downloading of all your CIX messages, and whatever
else you have asked for. The OLR then takes over and lets you read through
the messages, replying when you like. When you reply to a message, the OLR
makes a note of the message you replied to and the message you entered. As
you go along it creates a CIX script which contains all the commands and
text necessary to post your replies on CIX into the right places. Most
OLR's will also handle files, you can view a file list, pick a file and on
your next login to CIX your file will be downloaded.

CIX now officially supports the AMEOL offline reader for more information
type: HELP AMEOL or join ameol/files and type: FLIST, then download the
latest version of AMEOL.
 ============== online =============
ONLINE
      At the Main: prompt, ONLINE displays the number of minutes and 
      seconds you have been using CIX.
 ============== opt =============
Command:   OPTION -- configure CIX to your settings.

Prompts:   Main:  Read:  Mail:

Format:    OPTION <option-command> [<option-command>...] QUIT

Example:   option buddy yes reference yes quit

Usage:     You may use the OPTION command interactively by entering just
           OPTION.  Most option-commands take a parameter.  If you omit the
           parameter then (depending on the option-command) CIX will use a
           default, prompt you or write a brief description of the parameter.
           You may find it useful to force a prompt or description by entering
           a dummy parameter, such as "?".

Notes:     1. Enter SHOW OPTION to display your current settings.

           2. To make a permanent change to your settings, edit your profile
              using the EDIT PROFILE command.  You cannot use OPTION

 ============== options =============
Command:   OPTION -- configure CIX to your settings.

Prompts:   Main:  Read:  Mail:

Format:    OPTION <option-command> [<option-command>...] QUIT

Example:   option buddy yes reference yes quit

Notes:     1. Enter SHOW OPTION to display your current settings.

           2. To make a permanent change to your settings, edit your profile
              using the EDIT PROFILE command.  Remember to end the OPTION
              command with QUIT!

Option-commands:

?
   Display a list of the option commands.  Note: this always leaves you at the
   Opt: prompt.

ANSI YES YES
   Highlight the CIX prompts, using the default ANSI codes.
ANSI YES NO
   Highlight the CIX prompts.  CIX prompts you for the ANSI codes to use.
   Enter HELP ANSI for further details.
ANSI NO
   This is the default setting.

AUTORECENT YES | ON
   Automatically skip to recent messages when you register in a conference or
   re-join a topic from which you've resigned.  See also OPTION RECENT.
AUTORECENT NO
   This is the default setting.

BACKWARD
   Causes CIX to `rub out' its output (such as the More? prompt) using a
   series of backspace characters.  Normally, CIX uses a combination of
   backspace and space characters. There is no way to reverse this setting
   other than by logging off and on again.

BUDDY YES
   At each prompt, CIX displays a list of valid commands.
BUDDY NO
   This is the default setting.

COMPACTHEADER YES
   Display message headers in compact form.
COMPACTHEADER NO
   Display message headers in expanded form.  This is the default setting.

DOWNLOAD <protocol>
   Specify the file transfer protocol to use when CIX sends you a file.
   Specify the first letter of one of the following: Kermit, Xmodem,
   CRC Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem.  See also the UPLOAD and ZWINDOW options.

EDIT <editor>
   Specify the editor to use when writing messages:
   A:       Use a text gobbler for new messages; use the full-screen editor if
            your scratchpad already contains a message.
   B:       The full-screen editor
   QUIET:   The quiet editor
   VERBOSE: The default editor

   Type: HELP EDITOR for more help with the CIX editors.

FILE SINGLE YES
   For FILE READ ALL, check each topic only once for new messages.
FILE SINGLE NO
   Check each topic for new messages, and continue checking until there are no
   more new messages (someone might add a message during the FILE READ ALL).
   This is the default setting.

FILTER NO
   Display special control characters in messages as ^A, ^B, etc.  This is
   overridden by the RAW option.
FILTER YES
   Display special control characters in messages, unchanged.  This is the
   default option.

HEADER YES
   Display only the header and first non-blank line of messages.  See also
   OPTION MESSAGESIZE and the HEADER command.
HEADER NO
   Revert to displaying the complete text of messages.

HELP
   Display brief help on the OPTION command.

MESSAGESIZE <bytes>
   Set the maximum size of a conference message for reading or filing.  If the
   size of a message exceeds the specification, only the message header and
   first non-blank line are shown.

MISSING YES
   Include the headers and markers of withdrawn messages in the output of an
   ALL or FILE READ ALL command.
MISSING NO
   Suppress withdrawn messages.  This is the default setting.

RAW
   Display any special characters in messages.  Messages are terminated with
   an ETX ($03) character.  To toggle off this setting, issue OPTION RAW
   again.

RECENT <number>
   Specify the number of messages for the SKIP TO RECENT command and the
   AUTORECENT option.

REFERENCE YES | ON
   Display all comments to a message before displaying other messages.  See
   also the REFERENCE command.
REFERENCE NO
   Display messages in numerical order.  See also the FORWARD command.

SCRATCHNAME <name>
   Specify the name (from 1 to 10 characters) of your scratchpad.  Any
   existing scratchpad and/or ARC'd scratchpad is renamed.  (An ARC'd
   scratchpad retains the .arc suffix.)

SCRATCHPAD <bytes>
   Specify the maximum size of your scratchpad for filing conference messages.
   The last message is filed in its entirety, and will probably cause the
   limit to be exceeded slightly.  This option has no effect when you file
   mail or Usenet messages.

STAY
   Stay in a topic until you explicitly leave it (for instance, by issuing the
   JOIN or QUIT command).  This is useful if you wish to file all messages in
   a single topic (using FILE SKIP TO 1; FILE READ ALL).  Issue OPTION STAY
   again to toggle off this setting.

SUBSTITUTE <new> <old>
   Substitute the command <new> for the command <old>.  See also the SYNONYM
   option.

SYNONYM <new> <old>
   Make the command <new> a synonym of the command <old>.  See also the MACRO
   command.

TERMINAL ERASE {BACKSPACE | DELETE}
   Specify the character you wish to use to erase the last character you
   entered.  The default is BACKSPACE.

TERMINAL PAGELENGTH <lines>
   Specify the number of lines CIX displays between More? prompts.  You may
   turn off the More? prompt and allow CIX to scroll continuously by
   specifying a page length of 0.  (Enter <control>X to cancel output.)

TERMINAL TYPE <type>
   Specify your terminal type.  CIX recognises the following types in the
   full-screen editor: ANSI, VT52, VT100, TVI920.

TERMINAL WIDTH <characters>
   Specify the width of your terminal.  A large value effectively disables
   wordwrapping when you enter a message using the default (Verbose) editor.
   
TERSE
   Use the abbreviated form of prompts and expanded message headers.  CIX
   doesn't display a list of commands if you enter an invalid command.  See
   also the TERSE command and the COMPACTHEADER and VERBOSE options.

TIMEOUT <minutes>
   Specify the interval after which CIX warns you you will be logged off --
   if you don't enter a command, CIX logs you off after a further interval.
   A value of 0 disables the inactivity timeout.  NB: the timeout is
   automatically disabled when you are in CHAT mode or in an editor.

UNIX YES
   When you download a text file or ARC your scratchpad, lines are terminated
   with LF (line feed) characters only.
UNIX NO
   Lines are terminated with CR (carriage return) and LF characters.  This is
   the default setting.

UPLOAD <protocol>
   Specify the file transfer protocol to use when you send CIX a file.
   Specify the first letter of one of the following: Kermit, Xmodem,
   CRC Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem.  See also the DOWNLOAD option.

VERBOSE
   Use the long form of prompts and expanded message headers.  This is the
   default setting.  See also the VERBOSE command and the TERSE command and
   option.

ZWINDOW <bytes>
   Specify the size of the window for ZMODEM downloads.  A value of 0 causes
   CIX to stream continuously.  The default size depends on the speed of the
   modem connection.
 ============== order =============
(join) order

   "order" will allow you to reorder your conference list so that conferences
are read in the order you wish rather than the order of joining. The form of 
the command is:  

                    ORDER conf1 conf2 conf3 conf4 ...
or
                    ORDER FIRST conf1 conf2 conf3 conf4 ...
or
                    ORDER LAST conf1 conf2 conf3 conf4 ...

This will move (conf1),conf2,conf3 ... to after conf1, or to the start, or
to the end of the list.

 ============== orphans =============
Command:   ORPHANS -- list any files which are not in the flist.

Prompt:    Mod:

Format:    ORHANS [<topicname>]

See also:  FDIR, FLIST

Usage:     This command helps you maintain the flist by listing the names of
           files which are in the topic directory but not in the flist.

           If you entered the MODERATE command at the Main: prompt, you may
           specify the topic name; if you entered MODERATE at the Read:
           prompt, you should not specify the topic name.
 ============== participants =============
show participants
show p fred
add participants

    Participants are the (other) people in CoSy.  Some may be registered in
the same conference you are in, others may be members of other conferences.

    You can see who is participating in your conferences (by joining them and
doing a "show p"). You can also see all CoSy users via "show p all".  You
can not tell who are participants in conferences you can not "join".
 ============== password =============
COMMAND:        PASSWORD
PROMPT:         Main: Read:
SYNTAX:         PASSWORD
PURPOSE:        Change your password.

It is a good idea to change your password regularly, maybe the one you
have is too difficult to remember, or maybe you let someone know your
CIX password to give them a demonstration. If that happens then change
your password immediately.

Remember that the case is important.

/* PASSWORD help file updated 26/3/93 */

 ============== print =============
============SORRY==============
-------------------------------
Print is for In house CIX usage
-------------------------------
 ============== profile =============
EDit PROfile
 <logon>

Your PROFILE is a file containing CIX commands which is executed
whenever you log into CIX.  It can be used to set such options as
your default editor, file transfer protocols, compact headers, 
verbose or terse prompts , and so on.

The default profile for new users is:

news
option down x q
option up x q
option edit v quit
option autorecent on quit
option recent 20 quit

This displays the news, sets the up and download protocol to Xmodem, 
selects the verbose editor, turns autorecent on and sets the autorecent 
figure to 20.
 ============== protocol =============
File transfer protocols supported by CIX:

Zmodem (recommended)
Ymodem (useful)
Xmodem (not recommended)
Kermit (not recommended)

 ============== prune =============
Command:   PRUNE -- compress a topic.

Prompt:    Mod:

Format:    PRUNE [<topicname>]

See also:  TOPICSIZE

Usage:     Normally, a withdrawn message occupies the same space as the
           original message.  The PRUNE command makes a new copy of the topic,
           physically deleting any withdrawn messages.  This may be useful if
           the topic is approaching its size limit.  (This limit applies to
           all topics on CIX and cannot be changed by the moderator.)

Notes:     1. The PRUNE command temporarily makes a topic read-only.

           2. If you entered the MODERATE command at the Read: prompt, you
              should not specify the topic name.

           3. You may use the TOPICSIZE command to display the topic's size
              and size limit.
 ============== qed =============
quiet editor
 
The "quiet editor" is the Unix editor, which provides much more power and
flexibility than COSY's verbose editor.  This particular editor is HCR's
"ned", similar to "ed" and "ex".

Editor commands all take the form
   [addresses] command [parameters]
An address can be a line number or range of numbers, or the symbol ".",
representing the current line, or "$", representing the last line.
Addresses are usually optional, with "." (current line) the default.
A "+" or "-" before a number indicates a relative displacement.
 
Commands are single letter commands.

Parameters depend upon the command.  Regular expressions may be used in
search strings.

Some available commands  (default address shown in parentheses)
------------------------
(.)a
<text>
. 
	append <text> after the addressed line (.), and keep doing so until
	a "." is entered alone on a line.

(.,.)c
<text>
. 
	change the line(s) of text indicated to <text>.  Stop input with a
	"." on a line by itself.
 
(.,.)d
	delete the current line or a range of lines.

(.)i

(1,$)g/string/<command>
        on each line that 'string' is found on, perform the command
 ============== quiet =============
quiet editor
 
The "quiet editor" is the Unix editor, which provides much more power and
flexibility than COSY's verbose editor.  This particular editor is HCR's
"ned", similar to "ed" and "ex".

Editor commands all take the form
   [addresses] command [parameters]
An address can be a line number or range of numbers, or the symbol ".",
representing the current line, or "$", representing the last line.
Addresses are usually optional, with "." (current line) the default.
A "+" or "-" before a number indicates a relative displacement.
 
Commands are single letter commands.

Parameters depend upon the command.  Regular expressions may be used in
search strings.

Some available commands  (default address shown in parentheses)
------------------------
(.)a
<text>
. 
	append <text> after the addressed line (.), and keep doing so until
	a "." is entered alone on a line.

(.,.)c
<text>
. 
	change the line(s) of text indicated to <text>.  Stop input with a
	"." on a line by itself.
 
(.,.)d
	delete the current line or a range of lines.

(.)i
<text>
. 
	insert <text> before the current (or addressed) line.  Stop input
	with "." on a line by itself.
 
(.,.)p
	print the current or addressed lines.  "p" may also be appended to
	other commands (eg "dp" or "s/abc/xyz/p") to print the result.
 
q
	quit or exit the editor.  No automatic write of the file is done.
 
(.,.)s[n]/string1/string2/
	substitute the nth occurance of string1 on the addressed line(s)
	with string2.  Add a "g" (global) to replace all occurances on the
	line.  Default n=1.
	In <string1>, "^" means the beginning of the line, "$" means the
	end of the line, "." means any character.

(1,$)w
	write the addressed lines (default, the whole file) onto the given
	file (ie the file you are editing).

($)=
	type the line number of the addressed line.  Default is the last
	line number -- use ".=" to get the current line number.

(1,$)g/string/<command>
        on each line that 'string' is found on, perform the command
 ============== quit =============
     The "quit" command is used whenever you wish to exit the current level,
and want to return to CoSy.  It is commonly used to exit from things like:
 
mail
read
moderate
and edit.

 ============== rdonly =============
Command:   RDONLY -- toggle the read-only/read-write status of a topic.

Prompt:    Mod:

Format:    RDONLY <topicname>

Usage:     If the topic is currently in read-write status, issuing the RDONLY
           command will set it to read-only status.  This means that
           participants cannot enter messages, but you as moderator may still
           do so.  To return the topic to read-write status, issue the RDONLY
           command again.  When you issue the RDONLY command, CIX confirms the
           new status of the topic.

Notes:     1. There is no default topic name for RDONLY.  If you don't specify
              the topic name, CIX prompts you for it.

           2. If a topic is read-only, CIX informs you of this when you join
              it.
 ============== read =============
Command:    READ - to read the next message in a conference.

Usage:     Although this command is one of the most
           important functions of CIX, is very seldom
           actually typed.  The reason for this is that
           'read' is automatically invoked whenever there is
           anything new to read, by just hitting <cr>.

           'read' is more of an 'environment' than a
           command.  When you are 'read'ing a conference,
           the CIX prompt is 'Read:'.  You can examine the
           conference messages in various ways, the easiest
           is to just press <cr> and you will step through
           any messages you have not yet seen.

Notes:     For a complete list of the options available at
           the 'Read:' prompt just type 'help' from the
           'Read:' prompt.
 ============== read.add.cmds =============
Add-actions
 
After typing in the text of your message, you have the following options:
   Add.................Add the text as a message (or comment) and 
                       clear your scratchpad.
   Clear...............Clear your scratchpad and return to the Read: prompt.
   COntinue............Continue entering text using the word wrapping text
                       entry routine. (This text will be appended to the end
                       of the scratchpad)
   Edit................Invoke the text editor to edit or append text.
   Help................Display this message.
   List................Display the scratchpad so you can read your text
   Quit................Return to the Read: prompt without adding a message.
                       Your scratchpad will be left intact.

-.....................................current message - 1
?.....................................available commands
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<number> can be a number, or the words 'first' or 'last'
See "help date" for information on how to specify <date>
 ============== reference =============
REFerence : ("Reading-by-reference" Mode and the REF command)

Whilst reading through a conference, you may want to follow
not the numerical order of messages, but the order in which messages were
commented on, ie read a message, then read it's comments. The Reference
mode allows you to do this. After reading a message, when you are at the
Read: enter the command "REF" and if there is a comment, CIX will display it.
It will also set you into "Reading-by-reference" mode. The Read: prompt
will change to Read Ref:

Whenever, you press <return> to read the next message in this
mode, CIX will first display comments to the last message you read, so you
will be able to read messages in context. To turn off Reference mode, enter
FORWARD.

If you are already in Reference mode and you enter "REF", CIX
will still display the comment to the message you just read.

If you want "Reading-by-reference" as a default add
"OPT REF ON Q" to your profile. 
 ============== remove =============
Command:   REMOVE -- remove a participant or topic from a conference.

Prompt:    Mod:

See also:  REMOVE

Format:    REMOVE PARTICIPANT <username> [<username>...]

Format:    REMOVE TOPIC <topicname>
 ============== ren =============
Command:   REN <old-name> <new-name>

Prompt:    Mail: and Read:

It is often required to rename files either as a moderator from the Read:
prompt in one of your conference topics or in your private directory from
the Mail: prompt. 
 ============== reply =============
To reply to a just read mail message, type REPLY
To reply to an old mail message type  <no> REPLY
 ============== resign =============
     "RESIGN <conference name>" command will "un-register" you from that
conference.  It will no longer be listed when you do a "show", and any new
messages appended to it can no longer be seen by you.

   RESIGN <confname>/<topicname> will resign you from a topic.

Registration
------------
    You can be come "registered" in a conference via one of 2 routes:    

1) When "join"ing an open conference for the first time, you reply "yes" 
   to the query "Do you wish to register?"

2) When moderator adds you to the list of active participants.
 ============== restore =============
Command:   RESTORE -- restore your message pointers.

Prompt:    Main:

Format:    RESTORE

See also:  CHECKPOINT, STORE

Usage:     RESTORE resets your conference list to the state it had the last
           time it was stored.  This may be useful if, for instance, you file
           all new messages but then lose your scratchpad.

Notes:     1. RESTORE restores your conference list *exactly* as it was.  If
              you have joined (or been joined to by the moderator) a new
              conference since your conference list was last stored, RESTORE
              resigns you from that conference.

           2. CIX automatically stores your message pointers the first time
              you logon on a particular day, unless you were logged on at
              midnight.

           3. To restore your message pointers as they were when you logged on
              to the current session, issue STORE then RESTORE.

Command:   RESTORE -- reinstate a withdrawn message.

Prompt:    Read:

Format:    RESTORE [<msgno>]

See also:  WITHDRAW

Usage:     RESTORE reverses the effect of an earlier WITHDRAW command, unless
           the moderator has permanently removed withdrawn messages by issuing
           the PRUNE command.

           The default message number is that of the last message you read.

Notes:     1. CIX confirms the RESTORE command by displaying the message.

           2. RESTORE may be used by participants and moderators.  Of course,
              a participant may restore only a message he originated; a
              moderator may restore only a message she (or a co-moderator)
              withdrew.
 ============== resume =============
show resume
edit resume
show resume <participant>

   The resume file contains your name, address, and whatever else you want
other participants to know about you.
 ============== root =============
Read: ROOT
goes to the root of the message chain of current message.

 ============== run =============

Command:   RUN -- Run various additional commands to the normal CIX commands
           listed from the subsystem prompts. 

Prompts:   Main: Read: and Mail:

Format:    RUN <command>   (see table below)

Example:   RUN INTERNET

Command    What does it do?
-------    ----------------
newsnet    The Read Write Usenet Gateway - with threads..
confstat   Conference statistic program.
internet   The CIX Internet gateway
filestats  Gives you information on number of file downloaded in a given topic.
laston     Tells you when you last logged onto CIX.
load       Gives you a indication of the current load on the machine.
modlist    Tells you which conferences you moderate.

 ============== say =============

Prompt:		Read:

Format:		SAY

See also:	COMMENT

Usage:		"say" will allow you to enter text (via edit of SCRATCHPAD)
		that will become a root message in the conference/topic
		you are currently reading.  See "help comment" for
		details of how to make a comment to the last message
		read.

 ============== scgadd =============
SCGADD

Gets the contents of one of the following user files and appends to the text
in your scratchpad:

Profile, Resume, Script or a topics Flist.

Usage:    SCGADD PROFILE|RESUME|SCRIPT|FLIST
 ============== scget =============
SCGET

Gets the contents of one of the following user files and puts the text
into your scratchpad:

Profile, Resume, Script or a topics Flist.

Usage:    SCGET PROFILE|RESUME|SCRIPT|FLIST
 ============== scpadd =============
SCPADD

Gets the text from your scratchpad and appends to one of the following
user files: 

Profile, Resume, Script or a topics Flist if you are the moderator of
that conference.

Usage:    SCPADD PROFILE|RESUME|SCRIPT|FLIST
 ============== scput =============
SCPUT

Puts the text in your scratchpad into one of the following user files:

Profile, Resume, Script or a topics Flist if you are the moderator of
that conference.

Usage:    SCPUT PROFILE|RESUME|SCRIPT|FLIST
 ============== scratchpad =============
Your private textfile.
You can upload to it, using UPLOAD
You can download it , using DOWNLOAD
You can delete it   , using KILLSCRATCH
You can ask for size, using SCRATCHSIZE
You can edit it     , using EDIT
You can add it as a message
You can send it as a mail message
You are expected to delete it when you log off.

The lines in the scratchpad are terminated with LF. But when archiving
or downloading, the lines become CRLF terminated, unless you have set
option Unix. When doing a Zmodem download you can inhibit the addition
of CRs by setting an option in your comms program

 ============== scratchsize =============
SCRATCHSIZE
        At the Main: prompt, SCRATCHSIZE displays the size of the SCRATCHPAD
        and of the Archived SCRATCHPAD (If there is one)

OPT SCRATCHPAD 4567 Q sets the maximum size of the scratchpad during filing.
 ============== script =============
The CIX Script Language

A CIX script contains CIX commands. When you issue the SCRIPT command, CIX
reads commands from the script instead from your terminal; when the last
command in the script has been read, CIX returns control to your terminal.
You can prepare your script offline, upload it to CIX and run it, so saving
online time. Typically, you would use a script to enter messages in a
conference and send mail messages.

Entering conference messages:

Scripts always use the Verbose editor, even if you have changed the editor in
your profile. The Verbose editor automatically wraps lines at 10 characters
less than the line width setting. Your message may be wider than this, so you
should disable CIX's word wrapping by starting your script with the command:

   OPTION TERMINAL WIDTH 999 QUIT

Similarly, end your script with a command to reset the terminal width to 79
(or whatever other width you have in your profile). The second line of your
script will probably be a JOIN <command>.

When you're commenting online to an earlier message, you would normally enter
the command COMMENT: commenting, of course, to the message you've just read.
When you write a script, you're unlikely to want to comment to the last
message you've read, and you're quite likely to want to comment to more than
one message. You can specify which message you want to comment to by
including the message number: COMMENT <msgno>.

Enter your comment in the script and finish it with a full stop (.) in the
normal way. If you were commenting online, at this point CIX would display
the Add/action: prompt. If you're running a script, though, CIX doesn't
display the prompt (there's not much point!) Instead, your message is added
directly CIX sees the full stop.

If you use the SAY command in a script, CIX doesn't prompt you for the title:
you simply enter the title as the first line of your message, *including* the
`TITLE:' prefix.

Entering mail messages:

Much the same considerations apply to entering mail messages as to entering
conference messages. One difference is that CIX expects a response to the
Send/Action: prompt (even though it doesn't display the prompt!) This is so
that you can, if you wish, use the CC response (to send one or more carbon
copies) before responding SEND.

Please note that at present, you cannot use the REPLY or COMMENT commands for
mail in a script.

Running the script:

Start by uploading the script to your scratchpad by issuing the UPLOAD
command. Then move the script from your scratchpad to your script area by
issuing the SCPUT SCRIPT command. Finally, issue the SCRIPT command to run
your script.

Note that your scratchpad is cleared after the SCPUT command. If you want to
amend your script before running it, you may issue the SCGET SCRIPT command
and then edit it in your scratchpad by issuing the EDIT command. Note also
that your script area is *not* cleared after the SCRIPT command. It is
overwritten, however, by the next SCPUT SCRIPT command.
 ============== search =============
Command:   SEARCH -- display message numbers of messages containing a word.

Prompt:    Read:

Format:    SEARCH <pattern> [[FROM] <msgno>] [TO <msgno>]

Example:   search widget 120 to 260

See also:  FIND, SQUICK.

Usage:     SEARCH looks in the current topic for the specified pattern and
           displays the message numbers of the messages which contain the
           pattern.  The pattern could be a word or a part of a word: it may
           not contain spaces.  You may use a question mark as a wildcard
           character, to match any single character.  For instance, "??dget"
           would match "widget" or "gadget".  You could also use a question
           mark to match a space if you wanted to locate two words.  For
           instance, "ibm?pc" would match "IBM PC", provided the words were
           not split across two lines.

           If you specify only the pattern, SEARCH scans all messages in the
           topic.  You may limit the search by specifying FROM <msgno> and/or
           TO <msgno>.  You may omit the FROM keyword.  TO <msgno> specifies
           the last message to be scanned (the range is inclusive).

Notes:     1. SEARCH is case-insensitive: upper-case and lower-case letters
              are treated equally.

           2. The maximum length of the pattern is 14 characters.

           3. The output from SEARCH looks like this:
   
              9999 : Text of the line where the pattern was found
              9999 - A name

              SEARCH uses the first format when it finds the pattern in the
              text of a message.  It uses the second format when the pattern
              matches the nickname in the message header.
 ============== send =============
  The "send" command will invoke an edit of SCATCHPAD to allow you to enter
the text of MAIL.  Upon exiting the editor, MAIL will ask for the distribution
list (who you wish to send the mail to).
 ============== show =============
SHOW
   Show is a flexible command which allows you to get extra information
   on conferences and users. Below are listed the variations of SHOW.

SHOW
  On it's own, SHOW displays the conferences you are joined to and where
  you are relative to the last message in each topic.

SHOW ALL
  Lists all the conferences available on CIX

SHOW ALL <string>
  Lists all the lines in the conference list with <string> in it. For
  example SHOW ALL PC or SHOW ALL GAMES

SHOW <conferencename>
  Shows the moderator, creation date, topics and titles and (if available)
  the conference note for that conference

SHOW NEW
  List conferences that you are joined to that have unread messages to be
  read

SHOW OPTION
  List the current value of various option settings.

SHOW PARTICPANTS
  List the members of the conference that you are presently joined to

SHOW PARTICIPANTS ALL
  List all the users of CIX

SHOW PARTICIPANTS <conferencename>
  List the members of the named conference 

SHOW RESUME <username>
  Show the Resume of the named user	

SHOW STATUS
  List the members of the conference you are currently joined to and when
  they were last on

SHOW STATUS <conferencename>
  As SHOW STATUS but for the named conference

SHOW WHO <string>
  List all members of CIX with <string> in their name entry
  Replace <string> with a * and you will get all members of CIX

There is a quick reminder of these commands if you do SHOW ?
 ============== show.cmds =============
SHOW
     <no option>...........list your conferences
     All...................list all conferences
     All <string>..........list titles with string
     <conf>................list conference details
     New...................conferences with activity
     Participants..........members of a joined conference
     Participants All......list members of the system
     Participants <conf>...members of specified conference
     PRICES <user>.........show users pricelist
     Resume <participant>..resume of a member
     Status................status of conference members
     Who <string>..........list names with string
     Who *.................list all users
 ============== skip =============
(read) skip <n>
       skip to <n>
       skip to back <n>
       skip backward <n>

   This will allow you to 'jump over' "n" messages.  These message will then
be considered 'seen' or 'read', but can be reviewed by several of the "read"
options later.
   "Skip to <n>" will set your pointer to message number <n>, and consider
all those after to be unread.
   "Skip to back 5" will set your pointer to "five days ago"
   "Skip backward <n>" is similar to "skip <n>", except that it allows you
to "back up" in the message list.
 ============== squick =============
Command:   SQUICK -- display message numbers of messages containing a pattern.

Prompt:    Read:

Format:    SQUICK "<pattern>" [<no_of_days>]

Example:   squick "widget" 2

See also:  FIND, SEARCH.

Usage:     SQUICK looks in the current topic for the specified pattern and
           displays the message numbers of the messages which contain the
           pattern.  The pattern must be within double quotation marks; this
           means it may contain spaces.  You may use a question mark as a
           wildcard character, to match any single character.  For instance,
           "??dget" would match "widget" or "gadget".

           If you specify only the pattern, SQUICK scans messages in the topic
           from 7 days ago to the last message.  Following the pattern, you
           may specify the number of days back to start the search.

Notes:     1. SQUICK is case-insensitive: upper-case and lower-case letters
              are treated equally.

           2. The maximum length of the pattern is 77 characters.

           3. The output from SQUICK looks like this:
   
              9999 : Text of the line where the pattern was found
              9999 - A name

              SQUICK uses the first format when it finds the pattern in the
              text of a message.  It uses the second format when the pattern
              matches the nickname in the message header.
 ============== status =============
STATUS
     at the Mail: prompt, displays the in and outbaskets

SHOW STATUS <confname>
     Displays all the participants who are joined to that conference
     and when they last logged on to CIX. This is available at most
     prompts
 ============== stay =============

COMMAND:        STAY
PROMPT:         Opt:
SYNTAX:         OPT STAY Q
PURPOSE:        Keeps you in a topic when no more unread there.

This toggle will stop CIX automatically joining you to the next topic
in your conference list when there are no more unread messages in the
topic you are currently in. Use the TNEXT command to get to the next
topic.

This toggle is especially useful if you want to do a FILE READ ALL of
particular topics.

/* STAY help file updated 26-3-93 */
 ============== store =============
Command:   STORE -- store your message pointers.

Prompt:    Main:

Format:    STORE

See also:  CHECKPOINT, RESTORE

Usage:     For each of the conference topics to which you're joined, CIX keeps
           a record of (pointer to) your current message.  STORE saves your
           message pointers as they were when you logged in, or when you last
           issued a CHECKPOINT command in the current session.

Notes:     1. CIX automatically stores your pointers the first time you logon
              on a particular day, unless you were logged on at midnight.

           2. You may use RESTORE at the Main: prompt to restore your pointers
              to the values they had before the previous manual or automatic
              store.
 ============== substitute =============
OPTION SUBSTITUTE <newname> <oldname> Q
Example:
OPT SUBST EXIT BYE Q
Bye will now be invalid as a command, exit used instead
Related commands: 
OPT SYNONYM <newname> <oldname> Q
MACRO <newname> <expansion>

 ============== switchtopic =============

COMMAND:        SWITCHTOPIC
PROMPT:         Read:
SYNTAX:         SWITCHTOPIC [<topicname>]
PURPOSE:        Move to another topic within a conference.

This works from within a conference to switch to another topic in that
conference. Typing SWITCHTOPIC on its own will prompt you with all of
the topics in the conference you are joined to.

In certain circumstances you will need the SWITCHTOPIC command to get
into a topic. If you have resigned a single topic you will have to
find all the topics using the SHOW <confname> command and then from
any of the topics in the conference type SWITCHTOPIC <topicname>.

/* SWITCHTOPIC help file updated 26-3-93 */
 ============== synonym =============
OPT SYNONYM <new> <old> Q ; make 'new' a synonym for the command 'old'
 ============== terminal =============
Terminal types supported are
vt100 (default)
tvi920, settable with OPT TERM TYPE TVI920 Q

To use full screen editting set OPT EDIT B Q, or OPT EDIT A Q

 ============== terminate =============
Command:   TERMINATE -- shut down a conference.

Prompt:    Mod:

Format:    TERMINATE

Usage:     TERMINATE shuts down a conference, and no messages may be added.
           When you issue the command, CIX asks you to confirm that you really
           want to terminate the conference.

Note:      The conference is not immediately deleted, so participants may
           still read messages.
 ============== terse =============
Mode:      TERSE - Gives you shorter CIX prompts and
           messages.

Usage:     There are two prompt and header modes of CIX.
           Terse mode gives you shorter prompts like

           M: for Main:   R: for Read:  and   Ml: for Mail:

           as well as a shorter message header when reading
           conference messages.

Example:   From Main:     prompt type   terse
                Read:     prompt type   terse
                Mail:     prompt type   terse
                Option:   prompt type   opt terse quit

           Any of the above will put your current CIX
           session, only, into terse mode.  To make this
           permenant you must put it in your profile, by
           editing your profile and entering the line

           opt terse quit

see also:   VERBOSE eg: help verbose - from Main: prompt.
            PROFILE eg: help profile - from Main: prompt.
 ============== time =============
The "time" command will display the current date and time.

 ============== tnext =============
Read: TNEXT
Goes to next topic in list, (which could be in another conference) 
irrespective of topic activity, not marking messages read

Read: TPREV
Goes to previous topic in list, (could be in next conference) 
irrespective of topic activity, not marking messages read 

Read: NEXT
Goes to next active topic in list, (could be in next conference) 
marking all messages read in current topic.

 ============== to =============
(read) <number> to <number>
       first to last
       date <date> to <date>

    The keyword "to" denotes a 'range' of messages to be displayed.
Some of the 'message identifers' can be intermixed (eg "18 to last")
 ============== topic =============
(moderate) add topic
(moderate) remove topic
join <conference> [ <topic> ]
next
tnext
tprev

  Topics are enties that are groups of messages within conferences.
Each topic starts at "first" and ends with "last".  When finished
reading all new messages in the current topic, CoSy goes on to the
next one automatically.
 ============== topicsize =============
Command:   TOPICSIZE -- display the current size and size limit of a topic.

Prompt:    Mod:

Format:    TOPICSIZE [<topicname>]

See also:  PRUNE

Usage:     Each topic has an upper limit to its size (this limit is
           system-wide and cannot be changed by the moderator).  TOPICSIZE
           displays this limit and the current size of the topic.

Notes:     1. If you entered the MODERATE command at the Read: prompt, you
              should not specify the topic name.

           2. The only limit of a topic is the size limit.  There is no limit
              on the number of messages.

           3. You may use the PRUNE command at the Read: prompt to physically
              delete any withdrawn messages and reclaim some space.
 ============== tprev =============
Read: TNEXT
Goes to next topic in list, (which could be in another conference) 
irrespective of topic activity, not marking messages read

Read: TPREV
Goes to previous topic in list, (could be in next conference) 
irrespective of topic activity, not marking messages read 

Read: NEXT
Goes to next active topic in list, (could be in next conference) 
marking all messages read in current topic.

 ============== type =============
Read: TYPE <filename> to view topic textfile.
Mail: TYPE <filename> to view private textfile

 ============== unix =============
The UNIX option explained.

Different operating systems use different methods to terminate lines in 
text files. For instance, Unix uses a Line Feed (LF) and PC / MS Dos uses a
Carriage Return and a Line Feed (CR/LF). So, when sending your scratchpad to
your computer you may find the text is either all on one line, or that it has
lots of ^M characters in it. Most text editors or word processing packages 
can take either LF or CR/LF as the end of line character.

The options you have are as follows:

OPT UNIX N Q	Allows your Zmodem package to convert LF to LF/CR if enabled.
OPT UNIX Y Q	Does not allow your Zmodem package to convert LF to LF/CR.
 ============== upload =============
upload
------
Main/Read Subsystem:
    In the 'main' or 'read' subsystem, "upload" is used to transfer a file
    from your micro into your COSY scratchpad (for addition to a conference,
    using say or comment).

upload <protocol>
----------------- 
Option Subsystem:
    In the 'option' subsystem, you can define the transfer protocol to use
    when uploading files.   Currently available are:

	upload kermit
	upload xmodem
	upload crc-xmodem
	upload ymodem
	upload zmodem (default)

example: OPT UP X Q

Related commands:
Read: FUL     ;upload file to topic
Mail: FUL     ;upload private file
For information on uploading programs type HELP FILES

 ============== ved =============
The verbose editor is the default editor.  If you have changed to another
editor, you may revert to the verbose editor by entering OPT EDIT V Q.

You enter the editor when you type "e" at the "add/action" or "send/action"
prompt or when you issue the EDIT command (see HELP EDIT).

All commands are one letter, shown below in brackets.

(l)ist     displays your text from start to end.  Line numbers are also
           displayed, which will be necessary if you wish to change or delete
           a line.  You may also specify a line number or range of line
           numbers.  For instance, you may enter "4l" to list line 4, or you
           may enter "4,10l" to list lines 4 through 10.

(a)ppend   allows you to add extra lines to your message.  If you enter "a" on
           its own, the lines are added below the existing lines.  You may
           also specify a line number.  For instance, if you enter "a4", the
           lines are inserted between lines 4 and 5.  To leave append mode,
           type a period (.) at the beginning of a new line, followed by
           return.

(d)elete   enters delete mode.  You will be asked which line number or range
           of line numbers you wish to delete, or you may specify this
           directly.  For instance, you may enter "d4" to delete line 4, or
           you may enter "d4,10" to delete lines 4 through 10.

(s)ubstitute
           enters substitute mode.  You will be asked which line number you
           wish to change, or you may specify this directly.  You may specify
           a line number by using, for instance, "s4"; or you may specify the
           last line by using "s*".  You will then be prompted to enter the
           substitution.  For instance, to change "copmuter" to "computer",
           enter "/copmuter/computer/".  If the text you wish to change
           includes a slash character, you may use any other character instead
           as the delimiter; for instance ";a/c;account;".  You may delete a
           string; for instance "/ and//" deletes the word "and".

           "." and "$" have special meanings in the "from" (first) string.

           "." is a wildcard and matches any other character.  So to change,
           for instance, "think. therefore" to "think, therefore", enter
           "/think./think,/".  Using "/./,/" will change the first character
           on the line to "," (since "." matches the first character).

           "$" on its own matches the end of the line, so you may use this to
           append to the line; for instance, "/$/ am./".  To change, for
           instance, "$1" to "#1", enter "/$1/#1/".  Using "/$/#/" will append
           "#" to the line.

e(x)it     exits the text editor, and passes the text you have prepared back
           to CIX.  This is the normal exit method.

(q)uit     exits the text editor, but DOES NOT return your text to CIX.

(h)elp     displays a brief summary of the available commands.
 ============== vedhelp =============
Command Meaning     Action

  x     exit        Exit and save current scratchpad. 
  a     append      Add additional text at end of scratchpad.
  c     clear       Delete all lines from scratchpad.
  d     delete      Delete one or more lines.
  l     list        Show all lines with line numbers.
  q     quit        Quit from editor, DON'T SAVE current scratchpad. This 
		    option leaves you with the scratchpad you had before you 
		    started editting.
  s     substitute  Change part of an existing line.

Enter HELP VED at the Main: Read: or Mail: prompt for more information.
 ============== verbose =============
Mode:      VERBOSE - Gives you full CIX prompts and
           messages.

Usage:     There are two prompt and header modes of CIX.
           Verbose is the default mode, giving you the
           longer prompts like

                      Main:  Read: and  Mail:

           as well as a more verbose message header when
           reading conference messages.

Example:   From Main:     prompt type   verbose
                Read:     prompt type   verbose
                Mail:     prompt type   verbose
                Option:   prompt type   opt verbose quit

           Any of the above will put your current CIX
           session, only, into verbose mode.  To make this
           permenant you must put it in your profile, by
           editing your profile and entering the line

           opt verbose quit

see also:   TERSE   eg: help terse - from Main: prompt.
            PROFILE eg: help profile - from Main: prompt.
 ============== vote =============
Command:   VOTE -- register your vote on a voting message.

Prompt:    Read:

Format:    VOTE

Usage:     The VOTE command applies to the message you have just read.  When
           you enter the VOTE command, CIX displays the list of voting options
           and prompts you to enter the number of the option for which you
           wish to vote.

Notes:     1. You may vote on only one message during a session.

           2. An ordinary mssage may be converted into a voting message by the
              moderator.  A voting message is indicated by a line in the
              header, or by a "V" in a compact header.  Underneath the body of
              the message, CIX displays the voting options and the votes
              registered so far.  (The voting options are not included in the
              character count in the header -- this may confuse some offline
              readers.)

Command:   VOTE -- add voting options to a message.

Prompt:    Mod:

Format:    VOTE [<topicname>] [<msgno>]

Usage:     If you entered the MODERATE command at the Main: prompt, CIX needs
           to know the topic name; if you don't specify it with the VOTE
           command, CIX prompts you.  If you entered the MODERATE command at
           the Read: prompt, you mustn't specify the topic name.

           If you entered the MODERATE command at the Main: prompt, the
           default message number is that given by your current pointer.  If
           you entered the MODERATE command at the Read: prompt, the default
           message number is that of the last message you read.  The message
           must not have been deleted.

           CIX prompts you for up to 9 lines of up to 39 characters.  When you
           have entered enough lines, enter QUIT.  You then have a chance to
           change any of the lines.  Finally, you may save the voting options
           or quit without saving them.  Once you have saved the voting
           options, you may not change or delete them.
 ============== vt100 =============
If using Odyssey's vt100 emulator, disable the menu-line, so
that you have 24 lines of screen. Otherwise you will have
problems.
 ============== who =============
Command:    WHO - Shows you who is online at the moment.

Usage:     When your logged onto CIX it's good to know who
           is online at the same time as you, you may want
           to 'chat' with someone.  The 'who' command will
           display the nicknames of all users who are
           currently online.

Example:   From Main:    prompt type   who
                Read:    prompt type   who
                Mail:    prompt type   who

Notes:     The 'who' command is also a keyword and may be
           used in conjunction with the 'show' command.

Example:   From Main:    prompt type   show who peter

           will list all users who have peter in their
           nickname or their real name.

see also:  SHOW, RESUME
 ============== wildcards =============
Wildcards ? and * are allowed many places, like in
FDL *

Notice that as CIX is running on a UNIX system, * will
match all files, whereas *.* will only match files with
an extension. This is different from MSDOS.

 ============== withdraw =============
CONVERSE:
    The "withdraw ####" command removes conv file "####" 
This command can be used to terminate or cancel a conversation, or to retract
a message.

READ:
    In the read subsystem, "withdraw ##" will flag message number "##" as
withdrawn by the author, so that the text will no longer be visible.  You
must be the originator of a message to be able to withdraw it.

 ============== wordwrap =============
Wordwrap is supported in the default textgobbler. There it results in
garbling of the screen output.

This garbling does not occur if OPT EDIT A Q is set. But then you dont
have wordwrap.

 ============== xmodem =============
Xmodem file transfer potocol by Ward-Christensen.
Blocksize typically 128 bytes, but can be 1024 bytes.
Each block is ended with a checksum (or a CRC).
This protocol is classic and easy to implement. (but not always
implemented correctly).
Xmodem becomes very slow if the reply to each block is delayed,
it is therefore very slow across MNP and high speed links.
It really is an outdated protocol, and Zmodem should be preferred.

 ============== ymodem =============
Ymodem file transfer protocol. This a batch protocol, where the filename
is specified by the sender, not by the receiver.  Several files can be
transferred in one go. Blocksize can vary from 128 bytes to 1024 bytes.

Many comms programs have several variations of Ymodem. The proper
one is often called 'batch ymodem' in these programs.
Your comms program/modem must not use XON/XOFF while doing Ymodem!

 ============== zmodem =============
Zmodem. Chuck Forsbergs file transfer protocol.
     The preferred file transfer protocol.
     It is fast, reliable, and an interrupted file transfer can be
     resumed.
     You should not have a an inacticitivy timeout in your modem, if you
     use this protocol, otherwise your modem will sometimes drop the
     line.
     When downloading your scratchpad lines will become terminated with
     CRLF if you have set your Zmodem options correctly
